<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>The writing of this book on that fascinating and somewhat
neglected<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> branch of garden literature&mdash;the old English Herbals&mdash;has
been a labour of love, but it could not have been done
without all the kind help I have had. My grateful thanks
are due to the authorities at the British Museum, to Professor
Burkitt of Cambridge, and very specially to Mr. J.&nbsp;B. Capper
for invaluable help. I am indebted to Dr. James, the Provost
of Eton, for his kind permission to reproduce an illustration
from a twelfth-century MS. in the Library of Eton College for
the frontispiece. I find it difficult to express either my indebtedness
or my gratitude to Dr. and Mrs. Charles Singer, the former
for all his help and the latter for her generous permission to
make use of her valuable bibliography of early scientific manuscripts.
I am further indebted to Dr. Charles Singer for reading
the chapter on the Anglo-Saxon herbals in proof. For their kind
courtesy in answering my inquiries concerning the MS. herbals
in the libraries of their respective cathedrals, I offer my grateful
thanks to the Deans of Lincoln and Gloucester Cathedrals, and
to the Rev. J.&nbsp;N. Needham for information concerning the
herbals in the library of Durham Cathedral; to the librarians
of the following colleges&mdash;All Souls&rsquo; College, Oxford; Balliol
College, Oxford; Corpus Christi College, Oxford; Corpus
Christi College, Cambridge; Emmanuel College, Cambridge;
Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge; Magdalene College,
Cambridge; Peterhouse, Cambridge; Jesus College, Cambridge;
St. John&rsquo;s College, Oxford, and Trinity College, Cambridge;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>viii]</a></span>
to the librarians of Durham University, Trinity College, Dublin,
the Royal Irish Academy, and the National Library of Wales;
to the Honble. Lady Cecil for information respecting MSS. in
the library of the late Lord Amherst of Hackney; and to the
following owners of private libraries&mdash;the Marquis of Bath,
Lord Leconfield, Lord Clifden, Mr. T. Fitzroy Fenwick of
Cheltenham, and Mr. Wynne of Peniarth, Merioneth. For information
respecting incunabula herbals in American libraries
I am indebted to Dr. Arnold Klebs and to Mr. Green of the
Missouri Botanical Garden, St. Louis.</p>

<p>No pains have been spared to make the bibliographies as
complete as possible, but I should be glad to be told of any
errors or omissions. There are certain editions of <i>Banckes&rsquo;s
Herbal</i> and <i>The Grete Herball</i> mentioned by authorities such
as Ames, Hazlitt, etc., of which no copies can now be found
in the chief British libraries (see p. <a href="#Page_204">204</a> <i>et seq.</i>). If any copies of
these editions are in private libraries I should be grateful to hear
of them. The rarest printed herbal is &ldquo;<i>Arbolayre conten&#257;t la
qualitey et vertus proprietiez des herbes g&#333;mes et sim&#275;ces extraite
de plusiers tratiers de medicine com&#772;ent davicene de rasis de constatin
de ysaac et plateaire selon le con&#772;u usaige bien correct</i>.&rdquo;
(Supposed to have been printed by M. Husz at Lyons.) It
is believed that there are only two copies of this book now
extant. One is in the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale, Paris; the
other was sold in London, March 23, 1898, but I have been
unable to discover who is the present owner. For this or any
other information I should be most grateful.</p>

<p>There is a certain pathos attached to the fragments from
any great wreck, and in studying the few Saxon manuscripts,
treating of herbs, which have survived to our day, we find
their primary fascination not so much in their beauty and
interest as in the visions they conjure up of those still older
manuscripts which perished during the terrible Danish invasions.
That books on herbs were studied in England as early as the
eighth century is certain, for we know that Boniface, &ldquo;the
Apostle of the Saxons,&rdquo; received letters from England asking
him for books on simples and complaining that it was difficult
to obtain the foreign herbs mentioned in those we already
possessed.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> But of these manuscripts none have survived, the
oldest we possess being of the tenth century, and for our knowledge
of Anglo-Saxon plant lore we look chiefly to those four
important manuscripts&mdash;the <i>Leech Book of Bald</i>, the <i>Lacnunga</i>
and the Saxon translations of the <i>Herbarium of Apuleius</i> and
the so-called <ins class="note" title="Peri Didaxe&ocirc;n">&#928;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#916;&#953;&#948;&#945;&#958;&#8051;&#969;&#957;</ins>.</p>

<p>Apart from their intrinsic fascination, there are certain
considerations which give these manuscripts a peculiar importance.
Herb lore and folk medicine lag not years, but centuries,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>2]</a></span>
behind the knowledge of their own day. Within living memory
our peasants were using, and in the most remote parts of these
islands they use still, the herbal and other remedies of our
Saxon ancestors. They even use curiously similar charms.
The herb lore recorded in these manuscripts is the herb lore,
not of the century in which they were written, but of the dim
past ages pictured in the oldest parts of <i>Widsith</i> and <i>Beowulf</i>.
To the student of English plant lore, the <i>Herbarium of Apuleius</i>
and the <ins class="note" title="Peri Didaxe&ocirc;n">&#928;&#949;&#961;&#8054;
&#916;&#953;&#948;&#945;&#958;&#8051;&#969;&#957;</ins> are less interesting because they are
translations, but the more one studies the original Saxon
writings on herbs and their uses, the more one realises that,
just as in <i>Beowulf</i> there are suggestions and traces of an age
far older than that in which the poem was written, so in these
manuscripts are embedded beliefs which carry us back to the
dawn of history. It is this which gives this plant lore its
supreme interest. It is almost overwhelming to recognise that
possibly we have here fragments of the plant lore of our ancestors
who lived when Attila&rsquo;s hordes were devastating Europe, and
that in the charms and ceremonies connected with the picking
and administering of herbs we are carried back to forms of
religion so ancient that, compared to it, the worship of Woden
is modern. Further, it is only in these manuscripts that we
find this herb lore, for in the whole range of Saxon literature
outside them there is remarkably little mention of plant life.
The great world of nature, it is true, is ever present; the ocean
is the background of the action in both <i>Beowulf</i> and <i>Cynewulf</i>,
and the sound of the wind and the sea is in every line. One is
conscious of vast trackless wastes of heath and moor, of impenetrable
forests and terror-infested bogs; but of the details of
plant life there is scarcely a word. In these manuscripts alone
do we find what plant life meant to our ancestors, and, as with
all primitive nations, their belief in the mystery of herbs is
almost past our civilised understanding. Their plant lore,
hoary with age, is redolent of a time when the tribes were still
wandering on the mainland of Europe, and in these first records
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>3]</a></span>
of this plant lore there is the breath of mighty forests, of marsh
lands and of Nature in her wildest. We are swept back to an
epoch when man fought with Nature, wresting from her the
land, and when the unseen powers of evil resented this conquest
of their domains. To the early Saxons those unseen powers
were an everyday reality. A supernatural terror brooded over
the trackless heaths, the dark mere pools were inhabited by
the water elves. In the wreathing mists and driving storms of
snow and hail they saw the uncouth &ldquo;moor gangers,&rdquo; &ldquo;the
muckle mark steppers who hold the moors,&rdquo; or the stalking
fiends of the lonely places, creatures whose baleful eyes shone
like flames through the mist. To this day some of our place
names in the more remote parts of these islands recall the
memory of those evil terrors. In these manuscripts we are
again in an atmosphere of eotens and trolls, there are traces of
even older terrors, when the first Teuton settlers in Europe
struggled with the aborigines who lived in caves, hints as elusive
as the phantom heroes in the Saxon poems, and as unforgettable.</p>

<p>Still more remarkable is the fact that beneath the superstructure
of Christian rites to be used when the herbs were being
picked or administered we find traces not merely of the ancient
heathen religion, but of a religion older than that of Woden. It
has been emphasised by our most eminent authorities that in
very early times our ancestors had but few chief gods, and it is a
remarkable fact that there is no mention whatever of Woden in
the whole range of Saxon literature before the time of Alfred.
In those earlier centuries they seem to have worshipped a personification
of Heaven, and Earth, the wife of Heaven, and the Son,
whom after ages called Thor. There were also Nature deities,
Hrede, the personification of the brightness of Summer, and
Eostra, the radiant creature of the Dawn. It will be remembered
that it was the worship, not of Balder, but of Eostra, which
the Christian missionaries found so deeply imbedded that they
adopted her name and transferred it to Easter. For this we
have the authority of Bede. Separate from these beneficent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>4]</a></span>
powers were the destroying and harmful powers of Nature&mdash;darkness,
storm, frost and the deadly vapours of moorland and
fen, personified in the giants, the ogres, the furious witches that
rode the winds and waves; in fact, the whole horde of demons
of sea and land and sky. It is the traces of these most ancient
forms of religion which give to the manuscripts their strongest
fascination.</p>

<p>Many of us miss all that is most worth learning in old
books through regarding anything in them that is unfamiliar
as merely quaint, if not ridiculous. This attitude seals a book
as effectually and as permanently as it seals a sensitive human
being. There is only one way of understanding these old writers,
and that is to forget ourselves entirely and to try to look at
the world of nature as they did. It is not &ldquo;much learning&rdquo;
that is required, but sympathy and imagination. In the case
of these Saxon manuscripts we are repaid a thousandfold; for
they transport us to an age far older than our own, and yet in
some ways so young that we have lost its magic key. For we
learn not only of herbs and the endless uses our forefathers made
of them, but, if we try to read them with understanding, these
books open for us a magic casement through which we look
upon the past bathed in a glamour of romance. Our Saxon
ancestors may have been a rude and hardy race, but they did
not live in an age of materialism as we do. In their writings
on herbs and their uses we see &ldquo;as through a glass darkly&rdquo; a
time when grown men believed in elves and goblins as naturally
as they believed in trees, an age when it was the belief of everyday
folk that the air was peopled with unseen powers of evil
against whose machinations definite remedies must be applied.
They believed, as indeed the people of all ancient civilisations
have believed, that natural forces and natural objects were
endued with mysterious powers whom it was necessary to
propitiate by special prayers. Not only the stars of heaven,
but springs of water and the simple wayside herbs, were to
them directly associated with unseen beings. There are times
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>5]</a></span>
when one is reminded forcibly of that worship of Demeter,
&ldquo;nearer to the Earth which some have thought they could
discern behind the definitely national mythology of Homer.&rdquo;
They believed that the sick could be cured by conjurations and
charms, as firmly as we believe to-day in curing them by suggestion&mdash;is
there any real difference between these methods?&mdash;and
when one reads the charms which they used in administering
their herbs one cannot help wondering whether these
were handed down traditionally from the Sumerians, those
ancient inhabitants of Mesopotamia who five thousand years
before Christ used charms for curing the sick which have now been
partially deciphered from the cuneiform inscriptions. But before
studying the plant lore therein contained, it may be as well to
take a preliminary survey of the four most important manuscripts.</p>

<p>The oldest Saxon book dealing with the virtues of herbs
which we possess is the <i>Leech Book of Bald</i>, dating from about
<small>A.D.</small> 900-950. Unlike some other MS. herbals of which only a
few tattered pages remain, this perfect specimen of Saxon work
has nothing fragile about it. The vellum is as strong and in
as good condition as when it first lay clean and untouched
under the hand of the scribe&mdash;Cild by name&mdash;who penned it
with such skill and loving care. One&rsquo;s imagination runs riot
when one handles this beautiful book, now over a thousand
years old, and wonders who were its successive owners and how
it has survived the wars and other destructive agencies through
all these centuries. But we only know that, at least for a time,
it was sheltered in that most romantic of all English monasteries,
Glastonbury.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> This Saxon manuscript has a dignity which is
unique, for it is the oldest existing leech book written in the
vernacular. In a lecture delivered before the Royal College of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>6]</a></span>
Physicians in 1903, Dr. J.&nbsp;F. Payne commented on the remarkable
fact that the Anglo-Saxons had a much wider knowledge
of herbs than the doctors of Salerno, the oldest school of medicine
and oldest university in Europe. &ldquo;No treatise,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;of
the School of Salerno contemporaneous with the <i>Leech Book of
Bald</i> is known, so that the Anglo-Saxons had the credit of
priority. Their Leech Book was the first medical treatise written
in Western Europe which can be said to belong to modern
history, that is, which was produced after the decadence and
decline of the classical medicine, which belongs to ancient
history.... It seems fair to regard it [the Leech Book], in a
sense, as the embryo of modern English medicine, and at all
events the earliest medical treatise produced by any of the
modern nations of Europe.&rdquo; The Anglo-Saxons created a
vernacular literature to which the continental nations at that
time could show no parallel, and in the branch of literature
connected with medicine, in those days based on a knowledge
of herbs (when it was not magic), their position was unique.
Moreover, the fact that the Leech Book was written in the
vernacular is in itself remarkable, for it points to the existence
of a class of men who were not Latin scholars and yet were
able and willing to read books. The Leech Book belongs to
the literary period commonly known as the school of Alfred.
It was probably written shortly after Alfred&rsquo;s death, but it is
more than probable that it is a copy of a much older manuscript,
for what is known as the third book of the Leech Book is evidently
a shorter and older work incorporated by the scribe when
he had finished the Leech Book proper.</p>

<p>The book itself was written under the direction of one Bald,
who, if he were not a personal friend of King Alfred&rsquo;s, had at
any rate access to the king&rsquo;s correspondence; for one chapter
consists of prescriptions sent by Helias, Patriarch of Jerusalem,
to the king.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> We learn the names of the first owner and scribe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>7]</a></span>
from lines in Latin verse at the end of the second part of
the MS.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Bald is the owner of this book, which he ordered Cild to write,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Earnestly I pray here all men, in the name of Christ,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That no treacherous person take this book from me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Neither by force nor by theft nor by any false statement.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why? Because the richest treasure is not so dear to me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As my dear books which the Grace of Christ attends.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>The book consists of 109 leaves and is written in a large,
bold hand and one or two of the initial letters are very faintly
illuminated. The writing is an exceptionally fine specimen of
Saxon penmanship. On many of the pages there are mysterious
marks, but it is impossible to conjecture their meaning. It
has been suggested that they point to the sources from which
the book was compiled and were inserted by the original
owner.</p>

<p>The <i>Leech Book of Bald</i> was evidently the manual of a
Saxon doctor, and he refers to two other doctors&mdash;Dun and
Oxa by name&mdash;who had given him prescriptions. The position
of the leech in those days must have been very trying, for he
was subjected to the obviously unfair competition of the higher
clergy, many of whom enjoyed a reputation for working
miraculous cures.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The leech being so inferior in position, it is
not surprising that his medical knowledge did not advance on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>8]</a></span>
scientific lines. He relied on the old heathen superstitions, probably
from an instinctive feeling that in pagan religion, combined
with the herb lore which had been handed down through the
ages, the mass of the people had a deep-rooted faith. Nothing
is more obvious in the Leech Book than the fact that the virtues
ascribed to the different herbs are based not on the personal
knowledge of the writer, but on the old herb lore. This gives
the Leech Book its special fascination; for it is the oldest
surviving manuscript in which we can learn the herb lore of our
ancestors, handed down to them from what dim past ages we
can only surmise. We have, therefore, to bear in mind that
what may strike our modern minds as quaint, or even grotesque,
is in the majority of instances a distorted form of lore which
doubtless suffered many changes during the early centuries of
our era. Nearly all that is most fascinating in the Leech Book
is of very ancient Indo-Germanic or Eastern origin, but one
cannot help wondering how much the Saxons incorporated of
the herb lore of the ancient Britons. Does not Pliny tell us
that the Britons gathered herbs with such striking ceremonies
that it would seem as though the Britons had taught them to
the Persians?</p>

<p>One cannot read Bald&rsquo;s manuscript without being struck by
his remarkable knowledge of native plants and garden herbs.
We are inferior to our continental neighbours in so many arts
that it is pleasant to find that in the ancient art of gardening
and in their knowledge of herbs our Saxon forefathers excelled.
It has been pointed out by eminent authorities that the Anglo-Saxons
had names for, and used, a far larger number of plants
than the continental nations. In the <i>Herbarium of Apuleius</i>,
including the additions from Dioscorides, only 185 plants are
mentioned, and this was one of the standard works of the early
Middle Ages. In the <i>Herbarius</i> of 1484, the earliest herbal
printed in Germany, only 150 plants are recorded, and in the
German <i>Herbarius</i> of 1485 there are 380. But from various
sources it has been computed that the Anglo-Saxons had names
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>9]</a></span>
for, and used, at least 500 plants.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> One feels instinctively that
the love of flowers and gardens was as deep-rooted in our
ancestors as it is in our nation to-day, and though we do not
know exactly what they grew in their gardens&mdash;which they
called wyrt&#541;erd (literally, herb-yard)&mdash;we do know that the
marigolds, sunflowers, peonies, violets and gilly-flowers which
make the cottage gardens of England so gay and full of colour
to-day were also the commonest plants in the Saxon gardens.
Fashions in large gardens have changed throughout the centuries,
and there are stately gardens in this country famed the world
over. But in regard to our cottage gardens we are staunchly
conservative, and it is assuredly the cottage garden which
is characteristically English. Incidentally, one cannot help
regretting that so many of our old Saxon plant names have
fallen into disuse. &ldquo;Waybroad,&rdquo; for instance, is much more
descriptive than &ldquo;plantain,&rdquo; which is misleading.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> &ldquo;Maythen&rdquo;
also is surely preferable to &ldquo;camomile,&rdquo; and &ldquo;wergulu&rdquo; is
more characteristic of that fierce weed than &ldquo;nettle.&rdquo; Those
of us who are gardeners will certainly agree that &ldquo;unfortraedde&rdquo;
is the right name for knotweed. And is not &ldquo;joy of the
ground&rdquo; a delightful name for periwinkle?</p>

<p>The oldest illustrated herbal which has come down to us
from Saxon times is the translation of the Latin <i>Herbarium
Apuleii Platonici</i>.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> The original Latin work is believed to date
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>10]</a></span>
from the fifth century, though no copy so ancient as this is in
existence now. The name Apuleius Platonicus is possibly
fictitious and nothing is known of the writer, who was, of
course, distinct from Apuleius Madaurensis, the author of the
<i>Golden Ass</i>. The Saxon translation of this herbal (now in the
British Museum) is supposed to date from <small>A.D.</small> 1000-1050, and
belongs to the school of &AElig;lfric of Canterbury. The frontispiece
is a coloured picture in which Plato is represented holding a
large volume which is being given him by &AElig;sculapius and the
Centaur, and on the other side of the page is a blue circle spotted
with white and red, within which is the name of the book:
&ldquo;Herbarium Apuleii Platonici quod accepit ab Escolapio et
Chirone centauro magistro Achillis.&rdquo; The book consists of 132
chapters, in each of which a herb is described, and there are
accompanying illustrations of the herbs. Throughout the book
there are also remarkable pictures of snakes, scorpions and
unknown winged creatures. It has been pointed out that the
figures of herbs are obviously not from the original plants, but
are copied from older figures, and these from others older still,
and one wonders what the original pictures were like. It is
interesting to think that perhaps the illustrations in this Saxon
herbal are directly descended, so to speak, from the drawings of
Cratevas,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Dionysius or Metrodorus, of whom Pliny tells us
&ldquo;They drew the likeness of herbs and wrote under them their
effects.&rdquo; The picture of the lily is very attractive in spite of
the fact that the flowers are painted pale blue. The stamens in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>11]</a></span>
the figure stand out beyond the petals and look like rays of
light, with a general effect that is curiously pleasing. One of
the most interesting figures is that of the mandrake (painted in
a deep madder), which embodies the old legend that it was
death to dig up the root, and that therefore a dog was tied to
a rope and made to drag it up. It is the opinion of some
authorities that these figures show the influence of the school
represented by the two splendid Vienna manuscripts of
Dioscorides dating from the fifth and seventh centuries. There
is no definite evidence of this, and though the illustrations in
the Saxon manuscript show the influence of the classical
tradition, they are poor compared with those in the Vienna
manuscript. To some extent at least the drawings in this
herbal must necessarily have been copies, for many of the
plants are species unknown in this country.</p>

has shown that this is in part translated from a treatise by an
eleventh-century writer, Petrocellus or Petronius, of the School

authorities, the School of Salerno, being a survival of Greek
medicine, was uncontaminated by superstitious medicine. Consequently
there are striking differences between this and the
other Saxon manuscripts. The large majority of the herbs
mentioned are those of Southern Europe, and the pharmacy is
very simple compared with the number of herbs in prescriptions
of native origin. As Dr. J.&nbsp;F. Payne<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> has pointed out, Herr
L&ouml;wenbeck&rsquo;s important discovery does not account for the whole
of the English book. The order of the chapters differs from
that of the Salernitan writer; there are passages not to be
found in the <i>Practica</i>, and in some places the English text gives
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>12]</a></span>
a fuller reading. It is fairly evident that the Saxon treatise is
at least in part indebted to the <i>Passionarius</i> by Gariopontus,
another Salernitan writer of the same period.</p>

<p>The <i>Lacnunga</i> (Harl. 585), an original work, and one of
the oldest and most interesting manuscripts, is a small, thick
volume without any illustrations. Some of the letters are
illuminated and some are rudely ornamented. At the top of
the first page there is the inscription &ldquo;Liber Humfredi Wanley,&rdquo;
and it is interesting, therefore, to realise that the British Museum
owes this treasure to the zealous antiquarian whose efforts
during the closing years of the seventeenth and early years of
the eighteenth century rescued so many valuable Saxon and
other MSS. from oblivion.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>To the student of folk lore and folk custom these sources of
herb lore are of remarkable interest for the light they throw on
the beliefs and customs of humble everyday people in Anglo-Saxon
times. Of kings and warriors, of bards and of great
ladies we can read in other Saxon literature, and all so vividly
that we see their halls, the long hearths on which the fires were
piled, the openings in the roof through which the smoke passed.
We see the men with their &ldquo;byrnies&rdquo; of ring mail, their crested
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>13]</a></span>
helmets, their leather-covered shields and deadly short swords.
We see them and their womenkind wearing golden ornaments
at their feasts, the tables laden with boars&rsquo; flesh and venison
and chased cups of ale and mead. We see these same halls at
night with the men sleeping, their &ldquo;byrnies&rdquo; and helmets
hanging near them, and in the dim light we can make out also
the trophies of the chase hanging on the walls. We read of
their mighty deeds, and we know at least something of the
ideals and the thoughts of their great men and heroes. But
what of that vast number of the human kind who were always
in the background? What of the hewers of wood and drawers
of water, the swineherds, the shepherds, the carpenters, the
hedgers and cobblers? Is it not wonderful to think that in
these manuscripts we can learn, at least to some extent, what
plant life meant to these everyday folk? And even in these
days to understand what plant life means to the true countryman
is to get into very close touch with him. Not only has suburban
life separated the great concentrated masses of our people from
their birthright of meadows, fields and woods; of Nature, in
her untamed splendour and mystery, most of them have never
had so much as a momentary glimpse. But in Saxon times
even the towns were not far from the unreclaimed marshes and
forests, and to the peasant in those days they were full not
only of seen, but also of unseen perils. There was probably
not a Saxon child who did not know something of the awe of
waste places and impenetrable forests. Even the hamlets lay
on the very edge of forests and moors, and to the peasant these
were haunted by giant, elf and monster, as in the more inaccessible
parts of these islands they are haunted still to those who
retain something of primitive imagination. And when we study
the plant lore of these people we realise that prince and peasant
alike used the simple but mysterious herbs not only to cure
them of both physical and mental ills, but to guard them from
these unseen monsters. Of the reverence they paid to herbs
we begin to have some dim apprehension when we read of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>14]</a></span>
ceremonies connected with the picking and administering of
them.</p>

<p>But, first, what can we learn of the beliefs as to the origin
of disease? Concerning this the great bulk of the folk lore in
these manuscripts is apparently of native Teutonic origin, or
rather it would be more correct to speak of its origin as Indo-Germanic;
for the same doctrines are to be found among all
Indo-Germanic peoples, and even in the Vedas, notably the
Atharva Veda. Of these beliefs, the doctrine of the &ldquo;elf-shot&rdquo;
occupies a large space, the longest chapter in the third book of
the <i>Leech Book of Bald</i> being entirely &ldquo;against elf-disease.&rdquo;
We know from their literature that to our Saxon ancestors
waste places of moor and forest and marshes were the resort of
a host of supernatural creatures at enmity with mankind. In
the <i>Leech Book of Bald</i> disease is largely ascribed to these elves,
whose shafts produced illness in their victims. We read of
beorg-&aelig;lfen, dun-&aelig;lfen, munt&aelig;lfen. But our modern word
&ldquo;elf&rdquo; feebly represents these creatures, who were more akin to
the &ldquo;mark-stalkers,&rdquo; to the creatures of darkness with loathsome
eyes, rather than to the fairies with whom we now associate the
name. For the most part these elves of ancient times were
joyless impersonations and creatures not of sun but of darkness
and winter. In the gloom and solitude of the forest, &ldquo;where
the bitter wormwood stood pale grey&rdquo; and where &ldquo;the hoar
stones lay thick,&rdquo; the black, giant elves had their dwelling.
They claimed the forest for their own and hated man because
bit by bit he was wresting the forest from them. Yet they
made for man those mystic swords of superhuman workmanship
engraved with magic runes and dipped when red hot in blood
or in a broth of poisonous herbs and twigs. We do not understand,
we can only ask, why did they make them? What is
the meaning of the myth? The water elves recall the sea
monsters who attended Grendel&rsquo;s dam, impersonations of the
fury of the waves, akin to Hnikarr, and again other water elves
of the cavernous bed of ocean, primeval deadly creatures,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>15]</a></span>
inhabiting alike the sea and the desolate fens, &ldquo;where the elk-sedge
waxed in the water.&rdquo; If some were akin to the Formori
of the baleful fogs in Irish mythic history and the Mallt-y-nos,
those she-demons of marshy lands immortalised by the Welsh
bards, creatures huge and uncouth &ldquo;with grey and glaring
eyes,&rdquo; there were others who exceeded in beauty anything
human. When C&aelig;dmon wrote of the beauty of Sarah, he
described her as &ldquo;sheen as an elf.&rdquo; With the passing of the
centuries we have well-nigh forgotten the black elves, though
they are still realities to the Highlander and too real for him to
speak of them. But have we not the descendants of the sheen
bright elves in the works of Shakespeare, Milton and Shelley?
One feels very sure that our Saxon ancestors would have understood
that glittering elf Ariel as few of us are capable of
understanding him. He is the old English bright elf. Did not
Prospero subdue him with magic, as our ancestors used magic
songs in administering herbs &ldquo;to quell the elf&rdquo;? Here is one
such song from the <i>Leech Book of Bald</i>, and at the end a
conjuration to bury the elf in the earth.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;I have wreathed round the wounds<br /></span>

</div>

<p>&ldquo;Sing also this many times, &lsquo;May earth bear on thee with all her
might and main.&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Leech Book of Bald</i>, III. 63.</p>

<p>This was for one &ldquo;in the water elf disease,&rdquo; and we read
that a person so afflicted would have livid nails and tearful
eyes, and would look downwards. Amongst the herbs to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>16]</a></span>
administered when the charm was sung over him were a yew-berry,
lupin, helenium, marsh mallow, dock elder, wormwood
and strawberry leaves.</p>

<p>Goblins and nightmare were regarded as at least akin to
elves, and we find the same herbs were to be used against
them, betony being of peculiar efficacy against &ldquo;monstrous
nocturnal visions and against frightful visions and dreams.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
The malicious elves did not confine their attacks to human
beings; references to elf-shot cattle are numerous. I quote the
following from the chapter &ldquo;against elf disease.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center">&ldquo;For that ilk [<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> for one who is elf-shot].</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go on Thursday evening when the sun is set where thou
knowest that helenium stands, then sing the Benedicite and
Pater Noster and a litany and stick thy knife into the wort,
make it stick fast and go away; go again when day and night
just divide; at the same period go first to church and cross
thyself and commend thyself to God; then go in silence and,
though anything soever of an awful sort or man meet thee, say
not thou to him any word ere thou come to the wort which on
the evening before thou markedst; then sing the Benedicite
and the Pater Noster and a litany, delve up the wort, let the
knife stick in it; go again as quickly as thou art able to church
and let it lie under the altar with the knife; let it lie till the
sun be up, wash it afterwards, and make into a drink with
bishopwort and lichen off a crucifix; boil in milk thrice, thrice
pour holy water upon it and sing over it the Pater Noster, the
Credo and the Gloria in Excelsis Deo, and sing upon it a litany
and score with a sword round about it on three sides a cross,
and then after that let the man drink the wort; Soon it will be
well with him.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Leech Book</i>, III. 62.</p>
</div>

<p>The instructions for a horse or cattle that are elf-shot runs
thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>17]</a></span>
&ldquo;If a horse or other neat be elf-shot take sorrel-seed or
Scotch wax, let a man sing twelve Masses over it and put holy
water on the horse or on whatsoever neat it be; have the worts
always with thee. For the same take the eye of a broken
needle, give the horse a prick with it, no harm shall come.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Leech
Book of Bald</i>, I. 88.</p>
</div>

<p>Another prescription for an elf-shot horse runs thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;If a horse be elf-shot, then take the knife of which the
haft is the horn of a fallow ox and on which are three brass
nails, then write upon the horse&rsquo;s forehead Christ&rsquo;s mark and
on each of the limbs which thou mayst feel at: then take the
left ear, prick a hole in it in silence, this thou shalt do; then
strike the horse on the back, then will it be whole.&mdash;And write
upon the handle of the knife these words&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Benedicite omnia opera Domini dominum.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be the elf what it may, this is mighty for him to
amend.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Leech Book of Bald</i>, I. 65.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Closely allied to the doctrine of the elf-shot is that of &ldquo;flying
venom.&rdquo; It is, of course, possible to regard the phrase as the
graphic Anglo-Saxon way of describing infectious diseases; but
the various synonymous phrases, &ldquo;the on-flying things,&rdquo; &ldquo;the
loathed things that rove through the land,&rdquo; suggest something
of more malignant activity. As a recent leading article in <i>The
Times</i> shows, we are as a matter of fact not much wiser than
our Saxon ancestors as to the origin of an epidemic such as
influenza.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Indeed, to talk of &ldquo;catching&rdquo; a cold or any infectious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>18]</a></span>
disease would have struck an Anglo-Saxon as ludicrous,
mankind being rather the victims of &ldquo;flying venom.&rdquo; In the
alliterative lay in the <i>Lacnunga</i>, part of which is given below,
the wind is described as blowing these venoms, which produced
disease in the bodies on which they lighted, their evil effects
being subsequently blown away by the magician&rsquo;s song and the
efficacy of salt and water and herbs. This is generally supposed
to be in its origin a heathen lay of great antiquity preserved
down to Christian times, when allusions to the new religion
were inserted. It is written in the Wessex dialect and is believed
to be of the tenth century, but it is undoubtedly a reminiscence
of some far older lay. The lay or charm is in praise of nine
sacred herbs (one a tree)&mdash;mugwort, waybroad (plantain),
stime (watercress), atterlothe (?), maythen (camomile), wergulu
(nettle), crab apple, chervil and fennel.</p>

<p>In the chapter in the <i>Leech Book of Bald</i><a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> containing the
prescriptions sent by the Patriarch of Jerusalem to King Alfred,
we find among the virtues of the &ldquo;white stone&rdquo; that it is
&ldquo;powerful against flying venom and against all uncouth things,&rdquo;
and in another passage<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> that these venoms are particularly
dangerous &ldquo;fifteen nights ere Lammas and after it for five and
thirty nights: leeches who were wisest have taught that in
that month no man should anywhere weaken his body except
there were a necessity for it.&rdquo; In the most ancient source of
Anglo-Saxon medicine&mdash;the <i>Lacnunga</i>&mdash;we find the following
&ldquo;salve&rdquo; for flying venom:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;A salve for flying venom. Take a handful of hammer
wort and a handful of maythe (camomile) and a handful of
waybroad (plantain) and roots of water dock, seek those which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>20]</a></span>
will float, and one eggshell full of clean honey, then take clean
butter, let him who will help to work up the salve melt it thrice:
let one sing a mass over the worts, before they are put together
and the salve is wrought up.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>
</div>

<p>But it is in the doctrine of the worm as the ultimate source
of disease that we are carried back to the most ancient of sagas.
The dragon and the worm, the supreme enemy of man, which
play so dominating a part in Saxon literature, are here set
down as the source of all ill. In the alliterative lay in the
<i>Lacnunga</i> the opening lines describe the war between Woden
and the Serpent. Disease arose from the nine fragments into
which he smote the serpent, and these diseases, blown by the
wind, are counteracted by the nine magic twigs and salt water
and herbs with which the disease is again blown away from the
victim by the power of the magician&rsquo;s song. This is the
atmosphere of the great earth-worm Fafnir in the Volsunga
Saga and the dragon in all folk tales, the great beast with
whom the heroes of all nations have contended. Further, it is
noteworthy that not only in Anglo-Saxon medicine, but for
many centuries afterwards, even minor ailments were ascribed
to the presence of a worm&mdash;notably toothache. In the <i>Leech
Book</i> we find toothache ascribed to a worm in the tooth (see
<i>Leech Book</i>, II. 121). It is impossible in a book of this size to
deal with the comparative folk lore of this subject, but in
passing it is interesting to recall an incantation for toothache
from the Babylonian cuneiform texts<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> in which we find perhaps
the oldest example of this belief.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;The Marshes created the Worm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came the Worm and wept before Shamash,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">What wilt thou give me to devour?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">.&nbsp; &nbsp;.&nbsp; &nbsp;.&nbsp; &nbsp;.&nbsp; &nbsp;.&nbsp; &nbsp;.&nbsp; &nbsp;.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">May Ea smite thee with the might of his fist.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Closely interwoven with these elements of Indo-Germanic
origin we find the ancient Eastern doctrine which ascribes
disease to demoniac possession. The exorcisms were originally
heathen charms, and even in the <i>Leech Book</i> there are many
interesting survivals of these, although Christian rites have to a
large extent been substituted for them. Both mandrake and
periwinkle were supposed to be endowed with mysterious powers
against demoniacal possession. At the end of the description
of the mandrake in the <i>Herbarium of Apuleius</i> there is this
prescription:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;For witlessness, that is devil sickness or demoniacal
possession, take from the body of this same wort mandrake by
the weight of three pennies, administer to drink in warm water
as he may find most convenient&mdash;soon he will be healed.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Herb.
Ap.</i>, 32.</p>
</div>

<p>Of periwinkle we read:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;This wort is of good advantage for many purposes, that is
to say first against devil sickness and demoniacal possessions
and against snakes and wild beasts and against poisons and for
various wishes and for envy and for terror and that thou mayst
have grace, and if thou hast the wort with thee thou shalt be
prosperous and ever acceptable. This wort thou shalt pluck
thus, saying, &lsquo;I pray thee, vinca pervinca, thee that art to be
had for thy many useful qualities, that thou come to me glad
blossoming with thy mainfulness, that thou outfit me so that I
be shielded and ever prosperous and undamaged by poisons and
by water;&rsquo; when thou shalt pluck this wort thou shalt be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>22]</a></span>
clean of every uncleanness, and thou shalt pick it when the
moon is nine nights old and eleven nights and thirteen nights
and thirty nights and when it is one night old.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Herb. Ap.</i></p>

<p class="caption">MANDRAKE FROM A SAXON HERBAL</p>

<p class="subcapt">(Sloane 1975, folio 49<i>a</i>)</p>

<p>In the treatment of disease we find that the material remedies,
by which I mean remedies devoid of any mystic meaning, are
with few exceptions entirely herbal. The herb drinks were made
up with ale, milk or vinegar, many of the potions were made of
herbs mixed with honey, and ointments were made of herbs
worked up with butter. The most scientific prescription is
that for a vapour bath,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> and there are suggestions for what may
become fashionable once more&mdash;herb baths. The majority of
the prescriptions are for common ailments, and one cannot help
being struck by the number there are for broken heads, bleeding
noses and bites of mad dogs. However ignorant one may be
of medicine, it is impossible to read these old prescriptions without
realising that our ancestors were an uncommonly hardy race,
for the majority of the remedies would kill any of us modern
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>23]</a></span>
weaklings, even if in robust health when they were administered.
At times one cannot help wondering whether in those days,
as not infrequently happens now, the bulletin was issued that
&ldquo;the operation was quite successful, but the patient died of
shock!&rdquo; And, as further evidence of the old truth that there
is nothing new under the sun, it is pleasant to find that doctors,
even in Saxon days, prescribed &ldquo;carriage exercise,&rdquo; and moreover
endeavoured to sweeten it by allowing the patient to &ldquo;lap
up honey&rdquo; first. This prescription runs thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;Against want of appetite. Let them, after the night&rsquo;s
fast, lap up honey, and let them seek for themselves fatigue in
riding on horseback or in a wain or such conveyance as they may
endure.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Leech Book</i>, II. 7.</p>
</div>

<p>In the later herbals, &ldquo;beauty&rdquo; recipes are, as is well known,
a conspicuous feature, but they find a place also in these old
manuscripts. In the third book (the oldest part) of the <i>Leech
Book</i> there is a prescription for sunburn which runs thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;For sunburn boil in butter tender ivy twigs, smear therewith.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Leech
Book</i>, III. 29.</p>
</div>

<p>And in <i>Leech Book</i> II. we find this prescription:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;That all the body may be of a clean and glad and bright
hue, take oil and dregs of old wine equally much, put them into
a mortar, mingle well together and smear the body with this in
the sun.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Leech Book</i>, II. 65.</p>
</div>

<p>Prescriptions for hair falling off are fairly numerous, and there
are even two&mdash;somewhat drastic&mdash;prescriptions for hair which
is too thick. Sowbread and watercress were both used to make
hair grow, and in <i>Leech Book</i> I. there is this prescription:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;If a man&rsquo;s hair fall off, work him a salve. Take the mickle
wolf&rsquo;s bane and viper&rsquo;s bugloss and the netherward part of
burdock, work the salve out of that wort and out of all these and
out of that butter of which no water hath come. If hair fall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>24]</a></span>
off, boil the polypody fern and foment the head with that so
warm. In case that a man be bald, Plinius the mickle leech
saith this leechdom: &lsquo;Take dead bees, burn them to ashes,
add oil upon that, seethe very long over gledes, then strain,
wring out and take leaves of willow, pound them, pour the juice
into the oil; boil again for a while on gledes, strain them,
smear therewith after the bath.&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Leech Book</i>, I. 87.</p>
</div>

<p>The two prescriptions for hair which is too thick are in the
same chapter:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;In order that the hair may not wax, take emmets&rsquo; eggs,
rub them up, smudge on the place, never will any hair come up
there.&rdquo; Again: &ldquo;if hair be too thick, take a swallow, burn
it to ashes under a tile and have the ashes shed on.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>There are more provisions against diseases of the eye than
against any other complaint, and it is probably because of the
prevalence of these in olden days that we still have so many
of the superstitions connected with springs of water. Both
maythen (camomile) and wild lettuce were used for the eyes.
In the following for mistiness of eyes there is a touch of pathos:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;For mistiness of eyes, many men, lest their eyes should
suffer the disease, look into cold water and then are able to see
far.... The eyes of an old man are not sharp of sight, then
shall he wake up his eyes with rubbings, with walkings, with
ridings, either so that a man bear him or convey him in a wain.
And they shall use little and careful meats and comb their heads
and drink wormwood before they take food. Then shall a
salve be wrought for unsharpsighted eyes; take pepper and beat
it and a somewhat of salt and wine; that will be a good salve.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>One prescription is unique, for the &ldquo;herb&rdquo; which one is
directed to use is not to be found in any other herbal in existence.
This is &ldquo;rind from Paradise.&rdquo; There is a grim humour about
the scribe&rsquo;s comment, and one cannot help wondering what was
the origin of the prescription:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>25]</a></span>
&ldquo;Some teach us against bite of adder, to speak one word
&lsquo;faul.&rsquo; It may not hurt him. Against bite of snake if the man
procures and eateth rind which cometh out of Paradise, no
venom will hurt him. Then said he that wrote this book that
the rind was hard gotten.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>These manuscripts are so full of word pictures of the treatment
of disease that one feels if one were transported back to
those days it would in most cases be possible to tell at a glance
the &ldquo;cures&rdquo; various people were undergoing. Let us visit a
Saxon hamlet and go and see the sick folk in the cottages. On
our way we meet a man with a fawn&rsquo;s skin decorated with little
bunches of herbs dangling from his shoulders, and we know
that he is a sufferer from nightmare.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Another has a wreath
of clove-wort tied with a red thread round his neck. He is a
lunatic, but, as the moon is on the wane, his family hope that
the wearing of these herbs will prove beneficial. We enter a
dark one-roomed hut, the dwelling of one of the swineherds, but
he is not at his work; for it seemed to him that his head turned
about and that he was faring with turned brains. He had
consulted the leech and, suggestion cures being then rather more
common than now, the leech had advised him to sit calmly
by his fireside with a linen cloth wrung out in spring water on
his head and to wait till it was dry. He does so, and, to quote
the words with which nearly all Saxon prescriptions end, we
feel &ldquo;it will soon be well with him.&rdquo; Let us wend our way to
the cobbler, a sullen, taciturn man who finds his lively young
wife&rsquo;s chatter unendurable. We find him looking more gloomy
than usual, for he has eaten nothing all day and now sits moodily
consuming a raw radish. But there is purpose in this. Does
not the ancient leechdom say that, if a radish be eaten raw
after fasting all day, no woman&rsquo;s chatter the next day can
annoy? In another cottage we find that a patient suffering
from elf-shot is to be smoked with the fumes of herbs. A huge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>26]</a></span>
quern stone which has been in the fire on the hearth all day is
dragged out, the prepared herbs&mdash;wallwort and mugwort&mdash;are
scattered upon it and also underneath, then cold water is poured
on and the patient is reeked with the steam &ldquo;as hot as he can
endure it.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Smoking sick folk, especially for demoniac
possession, is a world-wide practice and of very ancient origin.
There is no space here to attempt to touch on the comparative
folk lore of this subject. Moreover, fumigating the sick with
herbs is closely akin to the burning of incense. Even in ancient
Babylonian days fumigating with herbs was practised.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> It was
very common all through the Middle Ages in most parts of
Europe, and that it has not even yet died out is shown by the
extract from <i>The Times</i> given below.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> I have purposely put
in juxtaposition the translation of the ancient Babylonian
tablet and the extract from <i>The Times</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>27]</a></span>
It is noteworthy that not only human beings, but cattle
and swine were smoked with the fumes of herbs. In the
<i>Lacnunga</i>, for sick cattle we find&mdash;&ldquo;Take the wort, put it upon
gledes and fennel and hassuck and &lsquo;cotton&rsquo; and incense. Burn
all together on the side on which the wind is. Make it reek
upon the cattle. Make five crosses of hassuck grass, set them
on four sides of the cattle and one in the middle. Sing about
the cattle the Benedicite and some litanies and the Pater Noster.
Sprinkle holy water upon them, burn about them incense and
cotton and let someone set a value on the cattle, let the owner
give the tenth penny in the Church for God, after that leave
them to amend; do this thrice.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Lacnunga</i>, 79.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To preserve swine from sudden death sing over them four
masses, drive the swine to the fold, hang the worts upon the four
sides and upon the door, also burn them, adding incense and make
the reek stream over the swine.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Lacnunga</i>, 82.</p>


<p class="hrpad">Herbs used as amulets have always played a conspicuous
part in folk medicine, and our Saxon ancestors used them, as
all ancient races have used them, not merely to cure definite
diseases but also as protection against the unseen powers of
evil,<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> to preserve the eyesight, to cure lunacy, against weariness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>28]</a></span>
when going on a journey, against being barked at by dogs, for
safety from robbers, and in one prescription even to restore a
woman stricken with speechlessness. The use of herbs as amulets
to cure diseases has almost died out in this country, but the use
of them as charms to ensure good luck survives to this day&mdash;notably
in the case of white heather and four-leaved clover.</p>

<p>There is occasionally the instruction to bind on the herb with
red wool. For instance, a prescription against headache in the
third book of the <i>Leech Book</i> enjoins binding waybroad, which
has been dug up without iron before sunrise, round the head
&ldquo;with a red fillet.&rdquo; Binding on with red wool is a very ancient
and widespread custom.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> Red was the colour sacred to Thor
and it was also the colour abhorred not only by witches in
particular but by all the powers of darkness and evil. An
ancient Assyrian eye charm prescribes binding &ldquo;pure strands
of red wool which have been brought by the pure hand of ...
on the right hand,&rdquo; and down to quite recent times even in
these islands tying on with red wool was a common custom.</p>

<p>Besides their use as amulets, we also find instructions for
hanging herbs up over doors, etc., for the benefit not only of
human beings but of cattle also. Of mugwort we read in the
<i>Herbarium of Apuleius</i>, &ldquo;And if a root of this wort be hung
over the door of any house then may not any man damage the
house.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;Of Croton oil plant. For hail and rough weather to turn
them away. If thou hast in thy possession this wort which is
named &lsquo;ricinus&rsquo; and which is not a native of England, if thou
hangest some seed of it in thine house or have it or its seed in
any place whatsoever, it turneth away the tempestuousness of
hail, and if thou hangest its seed on a ship, to that degree
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>29]</a></span>
wonderful it is, that it smootheth every tempest. This wort
thou shalt take saying thus, &lsquo;Wort ricinus I pray that thou be
at my songs and that thou turn away hails and lightning
bolts and all tempests through the name of Almighty God who
hight thee to be produced&rsquo;; and thou shalt be clean when thou
pluckest this herb.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Herb. Ap.</i>, 176.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;Against temptation of the fiend, a wort hight red niolin,
red stalk, it waxeth by running water; if thou hast it on thee and
under thy head and bolster and over thy house door the devil
may not scathe thee within nor without.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Leech Book</i>, III. 58.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;To preserve swine from sudden death take the worts
lupin, bishopwort, hassuck grass, tufty thorn, vipers bugloss,
drive the swine to the fold, hang the worts upon the four sides
and upon the door.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Lacnunga</i>, 82.</p>
</div>

<p>The herbs in commonest use as amulets were betony, vervain,
peony, yarrow, mugwort and waybroad (plantain). With the
exception of vervain, no herb was more highly prized than
betony. The treatise on it in the <i>Herbarium of Apuleius</i> is supposed
to be an abridged copy of a treatise on the virtues of this
plant written by Antonius Musa, physician to the Emperor
Augustus. No fewer than twenty-nine uses of it are given, and
in the Saxon translation this herb is described as being &ldquo;good
whether for a man&rsquo;s soul or his body.&rdquo; Vervain was one of the
herbs held most sacred by the Druids and, as the herbals of
Gerard and Parkinson testify, it was in high repute even as
late as the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. It has never
been satisfactorily identified, though many authorities incline
to the belief that it was verbena. In Druidical times libations
of honey had to be offered to the earth from which it was dug,
mystic ceremonies attended the digging of it and the plant was
lifted out with the left hand. This uprooting had always to be
performed at the rising of the dog star and when neither the
sun nor the moon was shining. Why the humble waybroad
should occupy so prominent a place in Saxon herb lore
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>30]</a></span>
it is difficult to understand. It is one of the nine sacred
herbs in the alliterative lay in the <i>Lacnunga</i>, and the epithets
&ldquo;mother of worts&rdquo; and &ldquo;open from eastwards&rdquo; are applied
to it. The latter curious epithet is also applied to it in
<i>Lacnunga</i> 46,&mdash;&ldquo;which spreadeth open towards the East.&rdquo;
Waybroad has certainly wonderfully curative powers, especially
for bee-stings, but otherwise it has long since fallen from its
high estate. Peony throughout the Middle Ages was held in
high repute for its protective powers, and even during the closing
years of the last century country folk hung beads made of its
roots round children&rsquo;s necks.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> Yarrow is one of the aboriginal
English plants, and from time immemorial it has been used in
incantations and by witches. Country folk still regard it as one
of our most valuable herbs, especially for rheumatism. Mugwort,
which was held in repute throughout the Middle Ages
for its efficacy against unseen powers of evil, is one of the nine
sacred herbs in the alliterative lay in the <i>Lacnunga</i>, where it is
described thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>With the notable exception of vervain, it is curious how little
prominence is given in Saxon plant lore to the herbs which were
held most sacred by the Druids, and yet it is scarcely credible
that some of their wonderful lore should not have been
assimilated. But in these manuscripts little or no importance
attaches to mistletoe, holly, birch or ivy. There is no mention of
mistletoe as a sacred herb.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> We find some mention of selago,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>31]</a></span>
generally identified with <i>lycopodium selago</i>, of which Pliny tells us
vaguely that it was &ldquo;like savin.&rdquo; The gathering of it had to be
accompanied in Druid days with mystic ceremonies. The Druid
had his feet bare and was clad in white, and the plant could not
be cut with iron, nor touched with the naked hand. So great
were its powers that it was called &ldquo;the gift of God.&rdquo; Nor is
there any mention in Saxon plant lore of the use of <i>sorbus
aucuparia</i>, which the Druids planted near their monolithic
circles as protection against unseen powers of darkness. There
is, however, one prescription which may date back to the Roman
occupation of Britain. It runs thus: &ldquo;Take nettles, and seethe
them in oil, smear and rub all thy body therewith; the cold will
depart away.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> It has always been believed that one of the
varieties of nettle (<i>Urtica pilulifera</i>) was introduced into England
by the Roman soldiers, who brought the seed of it with them.
According to the tradition, they were told that the cold in
England was unendurable; so they brought these seeds in order
to have a plentiful supply of nettles wherewith to rub their
bodies and thereby keep themselves warm. Possibly this
prescription dates back to that time.</p>

<p>From what hoary antiquity the charms and incantations
which we find in these manuscripts have come down to us we
cannot say. Their atmosphere is that of pal&aelig;olithic cave-drawings,
for they are redolent of the craft of sorcerers and they
suggest those strange cave markings which no one can decipher.
Who can say what lost languages are embedded in these unintelligible
words and single letters, or what is their meaning?
To what ancient ceremonies do they pertain, and who were the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>32]</a></span>
initiated who alone understood them? At present it is all
mysterious, though perhaps one day we shall discover both their
sources and their meaning. They show no definite traces of the
Scandinavian rune-lays concerning herbs, though one of the
charms is in runic characters. It is noteworthy that in the third
book, which is evidently much older than the first two parts of
the <i>Leech Book</i>, the proportion of heathen charms is exceptionally
large. In one prescription we find the names of two heathen
idols, Tiecon and Leleloth, combined with a later Christian
interpolation of the names of the four gospellers. The charm
is in runic characters and is to be followed by a prayer. Many
of the mystic sentences are wholly incomprehensible, in others we
find heathen names such as Lilumenne, in others a string of words
which may be a corrupt form of some very ancient language.
Thus a lay to be sung in case a man or beast drinks an insect
runs thus:&mdash;&ldquo;Gonomil, orgomil, marbumil, marbsai, tofeth,&rdquo;
etc.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>If some of the charms have a malignant sound, others were
probably as soothing in those days as those gems are still which
have survived in our inimitable nursery rhymes.</p>

<p>For instance, the following has for us no meaning, but even
in the translation it has something of the curious effect of the
words in the original. A woman who cannot rear her child is
instructed to say&mdash;&ldquo;Everywhere I carried for me the famous
kindred doughty one with this famous meat doughty one, so
I will have it for me and go home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the <i>Lacnunga</i> there is a counting-out charm which is a
mixture of an ancient heathen charm combined with a Christian
rite at the end.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;Nine were Noddes sisters, then the nine came to be eight,
and the eight seven, and the seven six, and the six five, and the

<p>One of the most remarkable narrative charms is that for
warts copied below from the <i>Lacnunga</i>. It is to be sung first
into the left ear, then into the right ear, then above the man&rsquo;s

<p>Of the world-wide custom of charming disease from the
patient and transferring it to some inanimate object we find
numerous examples. This custom is not only of very ancient
origin, but persisted until recent times even in this country.
As commonly practised in out-of-the-way parts of Great Britain
it was believed that the disease transferred to an inanimate
object would be contracted by the next person who picked it
up, but in the Saxon herbals we find an apparently older custom
of transferring the disease to &ldquo;running water&rdquo; (suggestive of
the Israelitish scapegoat), and also that of throwing the blood
from the wound across the wagon way. These charms for
transferring disease seem originally to have been associated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>34]</a></span>
with a considerable amount of ceremonial. For instance, in
those to cure the bite of a hunting spider we find that a certain
number of scarifications are to be struck (and in both cases an
odd number&mdash;three and five); in the case of the five scarifications,
&ldquo;one on the bite and four round about it,&rdquo; the blood is to
be caught in &ldquo;a green spoon of hazel-wood,&rdquo; and the blood is
to be thrown &ldquo;in silence&rdquo; over a wagon way. In the <i>Lacnunga</i>
there are traces of the actual ceremonial of transferring the
disease, and the Christian prayer has obviously been substituted
for an older heathen one. The charm is in unintelligible words
and is followed by the instruction, &ldquo;Sing this nine times and the
Pater Noster nine times over a barley loaf and give it to the horse
to eat.&rdquo; In a &ldquo;salve against the elfin race&rdquo; it is noticeable that
the herbs, after elaborate preparation, are not administered to
the patient at all, but are thrown into running water.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;A salve against the elfin race and nocturnal goblin visitors:
take wormwood, lupin.... Put these worts into a vessel, set
them under the altar, sing over them nine masses, boil them in
butter and sheep&rsquo;s grease, add much holy salt, strain through a
cloth, throw the worts into running water.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Leech Book</i>, III. 61.</p>
</div>

<p>One charm in the <i>Lacnunga</i> which is perhaps not too long to
quote speaks of some long-lost tale. It appears to be a fragment
of a popular lay, and one wonders how many countless generations
of our ancestors sang it, and what it commemorates:&mdash;</p>

<p>Who were these six smiths and who were the witches? One
thinks of that mighty Smith Weyland in the palace of Nidad
king of the Niars, of the queen&rsquo;s fear of his flashing eyes and the
maiming of him by her cruel orders, and of the cups he made
from the skulls of her sons and gems from their eyes. We
think of these as old tales, but instinct tells us that they are
horribly real. We may not know how that semi-divine smith
made himself wings, but that he flew over the palace and never
returned we do not doubt for an instant. To the fairy stories
which embody such myths children of unnumbered generations
have listened, and they demand them over and over again
because they, too, are sure that they are real.</p>

<p>Nor is the mystery of numbers lacking in these herbal
prescriptions, particularly the numbers three and nine. In the
alliterative lay of the nine healing herbs this is very conspicuous.
Woden, we are told, smote the serpent with nine magic twigs,
the serpent was broken into nine parts, from which the wind
blew the nine flying venoms. There are numerous instances
of the patient being directed to take nine of each of the ingredients
or to take the herb potion itself for three or nine days.
Or it is directed that an incantation is to be said or sung three
or nine times, or that three or nine masses are to be sung over
the herbs. This mystic use of three and nine is conspicuous in
the following prescription:&mdash;</p>

<p>Some of the most remarkable passages in the manuscripts
are those concerning the ceremonies to be observed both in the
picking and in the administering of herbs. What the mystery
of plant life which has so deeply affected the minds of men in all
ages and of all civilisations meant to our ancestors, we can but
dimly apprehend as we study these ceremonies. They carry us
back to that worship of earth and the forces of Nature which
prevailed when Woden was yet unborn. That Woden was the
chief god of the tribes on the mainland is indisputable, but even
in the hierarchy of ancestors reverenced as semi-divine the
Saxons themselves looked to Sceaf rather than to Woden, who
himself was descended from Sceaf. There are few more haunting
legends than that of our mystic forefather, the little boy asleep
on a sheaf of corn who, in a richly adorned vessel which moved
neither by sails nor oars, came to our people out of the great
deep and was hailed by them as their king. Did not Alfred
himself claim him as his primeval progenitor, the founder of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>37]</a></span>
our race? There is no tangible link between his descendant
Woden and the worship of earth, but the sheaf of corn, the symbol
of Sceaf, carries us straight back to Nature worship. Sceaf
takes his fitting place as the semi-divine ancestor with the lesser
divinities such as Hrede and Eostra, goddess of the radiant
dawn. It is to this age that the ceremonies in the picking of
the herbs transport us, to the mystery of the virtues of herbs,
the fertility of earth, the never-ceasing conflict between the
beneficent forces of sun and summer and the evil powers of the
long, dark northern winters. Closely intertwined with Nature
worship we find the later Christian rites and ceremonies. For
the new teaching did not oust the old, and for many centuries
the mind of the average man halted half-way between the two
faiths. If he accepted Christ he did not cease to fear the great
hierarchy of unseen powers of Nature, the worship of which was
bred in his very bone. The ancient festivals of Yule and Eostra
continued under another guise and polytheism still held its
sway. The devil became one with the gloomy and terrible
in Nature, with the malignant elves and dwarfs. Even with the
warfare between the beneficent powers of sun and the fertility
of Nature and the malignant powers of winter, the devil became
associated. Nor did men cease to believe in the Wyrd, that
dark, ultimate fate goddess who, though obscure, lies at the back
of all Saxon belief. It was in vain that the Church preached
against superstitions. Egbert, Archbishop of York, in his
Penitential, strictly forbade the gathering of herbs with incantations
and enjoined the use of Christian rites, but it is probable
that even when these manuscripts were written, the majority
at least of the common folk in these islands, though nominally
Christian, had not deserted their ancient ways of thought.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>38]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
When the Saxon peasant went to gather his healing herbs he
may have used Christian prayers<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> and ceremonies, but he did
not forget the goddess of the dawn. It is noteworthy how
frequently we find the injunction that the herbs must be picked
at sunrise or when day and night divide, how often stress is laid
upon looking towards the east, and turning &ldquo;as the sun goeth
from east to south and west.&rdquo; In many there is the instruction
that the herb is to be gathered &ldquo;without use of iron&rdquo; or &ldquo;with
gold and with hart&rsquo;s horn&rdquo; (emblems of the sun&rsquo;s rays). It
is curious how little there is of moon lore. In some cases the
herbs are to be gathered in silence, in others the man who gathers
them is not to look behind him&mdash;a prohibition which occurs
frequently in ancient superstitions. The ceremonies are all
mysterious and suggestive, but behind them always lies the
ancient ineradicable worship of Nature. To what dim past
does that cry, &ldquo;Erce, Erce, Erce, Mother of Earth&rdquo; carry us?</p>

<p>It is of these two invocations that Stopford Brooke (whose
translations I have used) writes: &ldquo;These are very old heathen
invocations used, I daresay, from century to century and from
far prehistoric times by all the Teutonic farmers. Who &lsquo;Erce&rsquo;
is remains obscure. But the Mother of Earth seems to be here
meant, and she is a person who greatly kindles our curiosity.
To touch her is like touching empty space, so far away is she.
At any rate some Godhead or other seems here set forth under
her proper name. In the Northern Cosmogony, Night is the
Mother of Earth. But Erce cannot be Night. She is (if Erce
be a proper name) bound up with agriculture. Grimm suggests
Eorce, connected with the Old High German &lsquo;erchan&rsquo; =
simplex. He also makes a bold guess that she may be the
same as a divine dame in Low Saxon districts called Herke or
Harke, who dispenses earthly goods in abundance, and acts in
the same way as Berhta and Holda&mdash;an earth-goddess, the
lady of the plougher and sower and reaper. In the Mark she is
called Frau Harke. Montanus draws attention to the appearance
of this charm in a convent at Corvei, in which this line begins&mdash;&lsquo;Eostar,
Eostar, eordhan modor.&rsquo; ... The name remains
mysterious. The song breathes the pleasure and worship of
ancient tillers of the soil in the labours of the earth and in the
goods the mother gave. It has grown, it seems, out of the
breast of earth herself; earth is here the Mother of Men. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>40]</a></span>
surface of earth is the lap of the Goddess; in her womb let all
growth be plentiful. Food is in her for the needs of men.
&lsquo;Hail be thou, Earth!&rsquo; I daresay this hymn was sung ten
thousand years ago by the early Aryans on the Baltic coast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Even in a twelfth-century herbal we find a prayer to Earth,
and it is so beautiful that I close this chapter with it:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;Earth,<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> divine goddess, Mother Nature who generatest all
things and bringest forth anew the sun which thou hast given
to the nations; Guardian of sky and sea and of all gods and powers
and through thy power all nature falls silent and then sinks in
sleep. And again thou bringest back the light and chasest
away night and yet again thou coverest us most securely with
thy shades. Thou dost contain chaos infinite, yea and winds
and showers and storms; thou sendest them out when thou wilt
and causest the seas to roar; thou chasest away the sun and
arousest the storm. Again when thou wilt thou sendest forth
the joyous day and givest the nourishment of life with thy
eternal surety; and when the soul departs to thee we return.
Thou indeed art duly called great Mother of the gods; thou
conquerest by thy divine name. Thou art the source of the
strength of nations and of gods, without thee nothing can be
brought to perfection or be born; thou art great queen of the
gods. Goddess! I adore thee as divine; I call upon thy name;
be pleased to grant that which I ask thee, so shall I give thanks
to thee, goddess, with one faith.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hear, I beseech thee, and be favourable to my prayer.
Whatsoever herb thy power dost produce, give, I pray, with
goodwill to all nations to save them and grant me this my
medicine. Come to me with thy powers, and howsoever I may
use them may they have good success and to whomsoever I may
give them. Whatever thou dost grant it may prosper. To
thee all things return. Those who rightly receive these herbs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>41]</a></span>
from me, do thou make them whole. Goddess, I beseech thee;
I pray thee as a suppliant that by thy majesty thou grant this
to me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now I make intercession to you all ye powers and herbs
and to your majesty, ye whom Earth parent of all hath produced
and given as a medicine of health to all nations and hath put
majesty upon you, be, I pray you, the greatest help to the human
race. This I pray and beseech from you, and be present here
with your virtues, for she who created you hath herself promised
that I may gather you into the goodwill of him on whom the art
of medicine was bestowed, and grant for health&rsquo;s sake good
medicine by grace of your powers. I pray grant me through
your virtues that whatsoe&rsquo;er is wrought by me through you may
in all its powers have a good and speedy effect and good success
and that I may always be permitted with the favour of your
majesty to gather you into my hands and to glean your fruits.
So shall I give thanks to you in the name of that majesty which
ordained your birth.&rdquo;</p>

This chapter consists of prescriptions containing drugs such as a resident
in Syria would recommend. It is interesting to find this illustration of Asser&rsquo;s
statement, that he had seen and read the letters which the Patriarch of
Jerusalem sent with presents to the king. From Asser also we learn that
King Alfred kept a book in which he himself entered &ldquo;little flowers culled

The stories of miraculous cures by famous Anglo-Saxon bishops and
abbots are for the most part too well known to be worth quoting, but the
unfair treatment of the leech is perhaps nowhere more clearly shown than
in Bede&rsquo;s tale of St. John of Beverley curing a boy with a diseased head.
Although the leech effected the cure, the success was attributed to the bishop&rsquo;s
benediction, and the story ends, &ldquo;the youth became of a clear countenance,
ready in speech and with hair beautifully wavy.&rdquo;</p>

A small but striking instance of Saxon knowledge, or rather close
observation, of plants is to be found in the following description of wolf&rsquo;s teazle
in the <i>Herbarium of Apuleius</i>:&mdash;&ldquo;This wort hath leaves reversed and thorny
and it hath in its midst a round and thorny knob, and that is brown-headed
in the blossoms and hath white seed and a white and very fragrant root.&rdquo;
The word &ldquo;reversed&rdquo; is not in the original and was therefore added by the
Saxon translator, who had observed the fact that all the thistle tribe protect
their leaves by thorns pointing backwards as well as forwards.</p>

There are numerous Latin MSS. of this book, chiefly in Italian libraries,
several being in the Laurentian Library at Florence. The book was first
printed at Rome, probably soon after 1480, by Joh. Philippus de Lignamine,
who was also the editor. De Lignamine, who was physician to Pope Sixtus IV.,
says that he found this MS. in the library of the monastery of Monte Cassino.
In the first impression the book is dedicated to Cardinal de Gonzaga; in the
second impression to Cardinal de Ruvere. (The copy in the British Museum
is of the second impression.) In this small quarto volume the illustrations
are rough cuts. It is interesting to remember that these are the earliest
known printed figures of plants. The printed text contains a large number
of Greek and Latin synonyms which do not appear in the Saxon translation.
Subsequent editions were printed in 1528 (Paris) and in the Aldine Collection
of Latin medical writers, 1547 (Venice).</p>

The directions for the vapour bath are given in such a brief and yet
forceful way that I cannot imagine anyone reading it without feeling at the
end as though he had run breathlessly to collect the herbs, and then prepared
the bath and finally made the ley of alder ashes to wash the unfortunate
patient&rsquo;s head. Like all these cheerful Saxon prescriptions, this one ends
with the comforting assurance &ldquo;it will soon be well with him,&rdquo; and one wonders
whether in this, as in many other cases, the patient got well in order to avoid
his friends&rsquo; ministrations. The prescription for a vapour bath made with
herbs runs thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take bramble rind and elm rind, ash rind, sloethorn, rind of apple tree
and ivy, all these from the nether part of the trees, and cucumber, smear wort,
everfern, helenium, enchanters nightshade, betony, marrubium, radish, agrimony.
Scrape the worts into a kettle and boil strongly. When it hath
strongly boiled remove it off the fire and seat the man over it and wrap the
man up that the vapour may get up nowhere, except only that the man may
breathe; beathe him with these fomentations as long as he can bear it. Then
have another bath ready for him, take an emmet bed all at once, a bed of
those male emmets which at whiles fly, they are red ones, boil them in water,
beathe him with it immoderately hot. Then make him a salve. Take worts
of each kind of those above mentioned, boil them in butter, smear the sore
limbs, they will soon quicken. Make him a ley of alder ashes, wash his head
with this cold, it will soon be well with him, and let the man get bled every
month when the moon is five and fifteen and twenty nights old.&rdquo;</p>

<i>A Pomeranian Rite.</i>&mdash;An attempt was made a few days ago to cast a
devil out of a woman living in a village of the Lauenberg district of Pomerania,
on the Polish frontier. She appears to have been of a sour and somewhat
hysterical temperament, and three of the village gossips came to the conclusion
that she was a victim of diabolical possession and resolved to effect
a cure by means of enchantment. They first of all gathered the herbs needed
for the purpose in the forest at the proper conjunction of the stars. Then
a tripod was formed of three chairs, and to these the patient was bound.
Beneath her was fixed a pail of red-hot coal on which the herbs were scattered.
As the fumes of the burning weeds veiled the victim the three neighbours
crooned the prescribed exorcism. The louder the woman shrieked the louder
they sang, and after the process had been continued long enough to prove
effective, in their opinion, they ran away, believing that the devil would run
out of the woman after them. She, however, continued to shriek. Her
cries were heard by a man, who released her.&mdash;<i>The Times</i>, December 5, 1921.</p>

Sonny (<i>Arch. f. Rel.</i>, 1906, p. 525), in his article &ldquo;Rote Farbe im Totenkulte,&rdquo;

Even modern science has not yet succeeded in solving some of the
mysteries connected with this remarkable plant. For instance, although the
apple and the pear are closely related, mistletoe very rarely grows on the
pear tree, and there is no case on record of mistletoe planted on a pear tree
by human hands surviving the stage of germination. There are, it is true,
two famous mistletoe pears in this country&mdash;one in the garden of Belvoir
Castle and the other in the garden of Fern Lodge, Malvern, but in both cases
the seed was sown naturally. It grows very rarely on the oak, and this possibly
accounts for the special reverence accorded by the Druids to the mistletoe
oak.</p>

St. Eloy, in a sermon preached in <small>A.D.</small> 640, also forbade the enchanting
of herbs:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Before all things I declare and testify to you that you shall observe
none of the impious customs of the pagans, neither sorcerers, nor diviners,
nor soothsayers, nor enchanters, nor must you presume for any cause to
enquire of them.... Let none regulate the beginning of any piece of work
by the day or by the moon. Let none trust in nor presume to invoke the
names of d&aelig;mons, neither Neptune, nor Orcus, nor Diana, nor Minerva, nor
Geniscus nor any other such follies.... Let no Christian place lights at the
temples or the stones, or at fountains, or at trees, or at places where three
ways meet.... Let none presume to hang amulets on the neck of man or
beast.... Let no one presume to make lustrations, nor to enchant herbs,
nor to make flocks pass through a hollow tree, or an aperture in the earth;
for by so doing he seems to consecrate them to the devil. Let none on the
kalends of January join in the wicked and ridiculous things, the dressing
like old women or like stags, nor make feasts lasting all night, nor keep up
the custom of gifts and intemperate drinking. Let no one on the festival of
St. John or on any of the festivals join in the solstitia or dances or leaping
or caraulas or diabolical songs.&rdquo;&mdash;From a sermon preached by St. Eloy in

<p>Between the Anglo-Saxon herbals and the early printed
herbals there is a great gulf. After the Norman Conquest the
old Anglo-Saxon lore naturally fell into disrepute, although
the Normans were inferior to the Saxons in their knowledge of
herbs. The learned books of the conquerors were written
exclusively in Latin, and it is sad to think of the number of
beautiful Saxon books which must have been destroyed, for
when the Saxons were turned out of their own monasteries the
Normans who supplanted them probably regarded books written
in a language they did not understand as mere rubbish. Much
of the old Saxon herb lore is to be found in the leech books
of the Middle Ages, but, with one notable exception, no important
original treatise on herbs by an English writer has come down
to us from that period. The vast majority of the herbal MSS.
are merely transcriptions of Macer&rsquo;s herbal, a medi&aelig;val Latin
poem on the virtues of seventy-seven plants, which is believed
to have been written in the tenth century. The popularity of
this poem is shown by the number of MSS. still extant. It
was translated into English as early as the twelfth century with
the addition of &ldquo;A fewe herbes wyche Macer tretyth not.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
In 1373 it was translated by John Lelamoure, a schoolmaster
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>43]</a></span>
of Hertford. On folio 55 of the MS. of this translation is the
inscription, &ldquo;God gracious of grauntis havythe yyeue and
ygrauted vertuys in woodys stonys and herbes of the whiche
erbis Macer the philosofure made a boke in Latyne the whiche
boke Johannes Lelamoure scolemaistre of Herforde est, they
he unworthy was in the yere of oure Lorde a. m. ccc. lxxiij
tournyd in to Ynglis.&rdquo; Macer&rsquo;s herbal is also the basis of a
treatise in rhyme of which there are several copies in England
and one in the Royal Library at Stockholm. This treatise,
which deals with twenty-four herbs, begins thus quaintly&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

<p>The poem begins with a description of betony, powerful against
&ldquo;wykked sperytis,&rdquo; and then treats, amongst other herbs, of
the virtues of centaury, marigold, celandine, pimpernel, motherwort,
vervain, periwinkle, rose, lily, henbane, agrimony, sage,
rue, fennel and violet. It is pleasant to find the belief that only
to look on marigolds will draw evil humours out of the head and
strengthen the eyesight.</p>

<p>The instructions for the picking of this joyous flower are given
at length. It must be taken only when the moon is in the sign
of the Virgin, and not when Jupiter is in the ascendant, for
then the herb loses its virtue. And the gatherer, who must be
out of deadly sin, must say three Pater Nosters and three Aves.
Amongst its many virtues we find that it gives the wearer a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>44]</a></span>
vision of anyone who has robbed him. The virtues of vervain
also are many; it must be picked &ldquo;at Spring of day&rdquo; in &ldquo;ye
monyth of May.&rdquo; Periwinkle is given its beautiful old name
&ldquo;joy of the ground&rdquo; (&ldquo;men calle it ye Juy of Grownde&rdquo;)

<p>A manuscript of exceptional interest is one describing the
virtues of rosemary which was sent by the Countess of Hainault
to her daughter Philippa, Queen of England, and apart from
its intrinsic interest it is important from the fact that it is
obviously the original of the very poetical discourse on rosemary
in the first printed English herbal, commonly known as Banckes&rsquo;s
herbal. Moreover, in this MS. there is recorded an old tradition
which I have not found in any other herbal, but which is still
current amongst old-fashioned country folk, namely, that
rosemary &ldquo;passeth not commonly in highte the highte of
Criste whill he was man on Erthe,&rdquo; and that when the plant
attains the age of thirty-three years it will increase in breadth
but not in height. It is the oldest MS. in which we find many
other beliefs about rosemary that still survive in England.
There is a tradition that Queen Philippa&rsquo;s mother sent the first
plants of rosemary to England, and in a copy of this MS. in the
library of Trinity College, Cambridge, the translator, &ldquo;danyel
bain,&rdquo; says that rosemary was unknown in England until the
Countess of Hainault sent some to her daughter.</p>

<p>The only original treatise on herbs written by an Englishman
during the Middle Ages was that by Bartholom&aelig;us Anglicus,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>45]</a></span>
and on the plant-lover there are probably few of the medi&aelig;val
writers who exercise so potent a spell. Even in the thirteenth
century, that age of great men, Bartholomew the Englishman
ranked with thinkers such as Roger Bacon, Thomas Aquinas
and Albertus Magnus. He was accounted one of the greatest
theologians of his day, and if his lectures on theology were as
simple as his writings on herbs, it is easy to understand why
they were thronged and why his writings were so eagerly
studied, not only in his lifetime but for nearly three centuries
afterwards. A child could understand his book on herbs, for,
being great, he was simple. But although his work <i>De Proprietatibus
Rerum</i> (which contains nineteen books) was the
source of common information on Natural History throughout
the Middle Ages, and was one of the books hired out at a regulated
price by the scholars of Paris, we know very little of the
writer. He spent the greater part of his life in France and
Saxony, but he was English born and was always known as
Bartholom&aelig;us Anglicus.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> We know that he studied in Paris
and entered the French province of the Minorite Order, and
later he became one of the most renowned professors of theology
in Paris. In 1230 a letter was received from the general of the
Friars Minor in the new province of Saxony asking the provincial
of France to send Bartholomew and another Englishman
to help in the work of that province, and the former
subsequently went there. We do not know the exact date of
<i>De Proprietatibus Rerum</i>, but it must have been written about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>46]</a></span>
the middle of the thirteenth century; for, though it cites Albertus
Magnus, who was teaching in Paris in 1248, there is no mention
of any of the later authorities, such as Thomas Aquinas, Roger
Bacon and Vincent de Beauvais. It was certainly known in
England as early as 1296, for there is a copy of that date at
Oxford, and there still exist both in France and in England
a considerable number of other manuscript copies, most of which
date from the latter part of the thirteenth century and the
early part of the fourteenth. The book was translated into
English in 1398 by John de Trevisa,<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> chaplain to Lord Berkeley
and vicar of Berkeley, and Bartholomew could scarcely have
been more fortunate in his translator. At the end of his
translation, Trevisa writes thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;Endlesse grace blysse thankyng and praysyng unto our
Lorde God Omnipotent be gyuen, by whoos ayde and helpe this
translacon was endyd at Berkeleye the syxte daye of Feuerer

of Kynge Rycharde the seconde after the Conqueste of Englonde
XXII. The yere of my lordes aege, syre Thomas, Lorde of
Berkeleye that made me to make this Translac&#333;n XLVII.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Salimbene shows that the book was known in Italy in 1283,
and there are two MS. copies in the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale of
Paris, of which the earliest is dated 1297. Before Trevisa made
his English translation, it had been translated into French by
Jehan Corbichon, in 1372, for Charles V. of France.</p>

<p>The book was first printed at Basle about 1470, and the
esteem in which it was held may be judged from the fact that
it went through at least fourteen editions before 1500, and
besides the English and French translations it was also translated
into Spanish and Dutch. The English translation was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>47]</a></span>
first printed by Caxton&rsquo;s famous apprentice, Wynken de Worde.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
The translator in a na&iuml;ve little introductory poem says that,
just as he had looked as a child to God to help him in his games,
so now he prays Him to help him in this book.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;C[?]Rosse was made all of red&nbsp;.<br /></span>

</div>
</div>

<p>And in the preface Trevisa addresses his readers thus:
&ldquo;Merveyle not, ye witty and eloquent reders, that I th&#563;ne of
wytte and voyde of cunning have translatid this boke from
latin to our vulgayre language as a thynge profitable to me and
peradventure to many other, whych understonde not latyn nor
have not the knowledge of the proprytees of thynges.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The seventeenth book of <i>De Proprietatibus Rerum</i> is on herbs
and their uses, and it is full of allusions to the classical writers
on herbs&mdash;Aristotle, Dioscorides and Galen&mdash;but the descriptions
of the plants themselves are original and charming.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>48]</a></span>
There is no record to show that Bartholomew the Englishman
was a gardener, but we can hardly doubt that the man
who described flowers with such loving care possessed a garden
and worked in it. The <i>Herbarius zu Teutsch</i> might have been
written in a study, but there is fresh air and the beauty of the
living flowers in Bartholomew&rsquo;s writings. Of the lily he says:
&ldquo;The Lely is an herbe wyth a whyte floure. And though the
levys of the floure be whyte yet wythen shyneth the lyknesse
of golde.&rdquo; Bartholomew may have known nothing of the
modern science of botany, but he knew how to describe not only
the lily, but also the atmosphere of the lily, in a word-picture
of inimitable simplicity and beauty. One feels instinctively
that only a child or a great man could have written those lines.
And is there not something unforgettable in these few words on
the unfolding of a rose&mdash;&ldquo;And wh&#257;ne they [the petals] ben
full growen they sprede theymselues ayenst the sonne rysynge&rdquo;?</p>

<p>The chapter on the rose is longer than most, and is so
delightful that I quote a considerable part of it. &ldquo;The rose
of gardens is planted and sette and tylthed as a vyne. And if
it is forgendred and not shred and pared and not clensed of
superfluyte: th&#275;ne it gooth out of kynde and chaungeth in to a
wylde rose. And by oft chaunging and tylthing the wylde rose
torneth and cha&#363;gith into a very rose. And the rose of ye
garden and the wylde rose ben dyuers in multitude of floures:
smelle and colour: and also in vertue. For the leves of the
wylde rose ben fewe and brode and whytyssh: meddlyd wyth
lytyll rednesse: and smellyth not so wel as the tame rose,
nother is so vertuous in medicyn. The tame rose hath many
leuys sette nye togyder: and ben all red, other almost white:
w<sup>t</sup> wonder good smell.... And the more they ben brused and
broken: the vertuo&#363;ser they ben and the better smellynge.
And springeth out of a thorne that is harde and rough: netheles
the Rose folowyth not the kynde of the thorne: But she arayeth
her thorn wyth fayr colour and good smell. Whan ye rose
begynneth to sprynge it is closed in a knoppe wyth grenes:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>49]</a></span>
and that knoppe is grene. And whan&#772;e it swellyth thenne
spryngeth out harde leuys and sharpe.... And wh&#257;ne they
ben full growen they sprede theymselues ayenst the sonne
rysynge. And for they ben tendre and feble to holde togyder

<p class="caption">WOODCUT OF TREES AND HERBS FROM THE SEVENTEENTH BOOK OF
&ldquo;DE PROPRIETATIBUS RERUM&rdquo;</p>

<p class="subcapt">Printed by Wynkyn de Worde (1495)</p>

<p>There follows a description, too long to quote here, of the
growth of the rose hip, which ends with the remark: &ldquo;But they
ben not ful good to ete for roughnesse that is hyd wythin. And
greuyth [grieveth] wythin his throte that ete thereof.&rdquo; ...
&ldquo;Among all floures of the worlde,&rdquo; he continues, &ldquo;the floure of
the rose is cheyf and beeryth ye pryse. And by cause of vertues
and swete smelle and savour. For by fayrnesse they fede the
syghte: and playseth the smelle by odour, the touche by softe
handlynge. And wythstondeth and socouryth by vertue ayenst
many syknesses and euylles.&rdquo; A delicious recipe is given for
Rose honey. &ldquo;Rose shreede smalle and sod in hony makyth
that hony medycynable wyth gode smelle: And this comfortyeth
and clenseth and defyeth gleymy humours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of the violet we read: &ldquo;Violet is a lytyll herbe in substaunce
and is better fresshe and newe than whan it is olde.
And the floure thereof smellyth moost.... And the more
vertuous the floure thereof is, ye more it bendyth the heed
thereof do&#363;warde. Also floures of spryngynge tyme spryngeth
fyrste and sheweth somer. The lytylnes thereof in substaunce
is nobly rewarded in gretnesse of sauour and of vertue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bartholomew&rsquo;s descriptions of flowers are usually brief,
and there is a clarity and vividness about them which give them
a charm peculiarly their own. How fresh and English, for
instance, is his chapter on the apple. I have never before seen
the taste of an apple described as &ldquo;merry,&rdquo; but how true
the description is! &ldquo;Malus the Appyll tree is a tree yt
bereth apples and is a grete tree in itself ... it is more short
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>50]</a></span>
than other trees of the wood wyth knottes and rinelyd Rynde.
And makyth shadowe wythe thycke bowes and braunches:
and fayr with dyuers blossomes, and floures of swetnesse and
lykynge: with goode fruyte and noble. And is gracious in syght
and in taste and vertuous in medecyne ... some beryth
sourysh fruyte and harde and some ryght soure and some ryght
swete, with a good savoure and mery.&rdquo; The descriptions of
celandine and broom are also characteristic. &ldquo;Celidonia is an
herbe w<sup>t</sup> yelowe floures, the frute smorcheth them that it
towchyth. And hyghte Celidonia for it spryngeth, other
blomyth, in the comynge of swalowes.... It hy&#541;t celidonia
for it helpith swallowes birdes yf their eyen be hurte other (or)
blynde.&rdquo; &ldquo;Genesta hath that name of bytterness for it is full
of bytter to mannes taste. And is a shrubbe that growyth in a
place that is forsaken, stony and untylthed. Presence thereof
is wytnesse that the grounde is bareyne and drye that it groweth
in. And hath many braunches knotty and hard. Grene in
wynter and yelowe floures in somer thyche [the which] wrapped
with heuy smell and bitter sauour. And ben netheles moost of
vertue.&rdquo; Bartholomew gives the old mandrake legend in full,
though he adds, &ldquo;it is so feynd of churles others of wytches,&rdquo;
and he also writes of its use as an an&aelig;sthetic.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> Further, he
records two other beliefs about the mandrake which I have
never found in any other English herbal&mdash;namely, that while
uprooting it one must beware of contrary winds, and that one
must go on digging for it until sunset. &ldquo;They that dygge
mandragora be besy to beware of contrary wyndes whyle they
digge. And maken circles abowte with a swerder and abyde
with the dyggynge unto the sonne goynge downe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But apart from herbs and their uses, the book <i>De herbis</i> is
full of fleeting yet vigorous pictures of the homely everyday
side of medi&aelig;val life. Bartholomew, being one of the greatest
men of his century, writes of matters in which the simplest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>51]</a></span>
of us are interested. He tells us of the feeding of swine with
acorns. Of the making and baking of bread (including the
thrifty custom of mixing cooked beans with the flour &ldquo;to
make the brede the more hevy&rdquo;). Incidentally, and with all
due respect, it may be remarked that he had no practical knowledge
of this subject, his vivid description being obviously that
of an interested spectator. There is an airy masculine vagueness
about the conclusion of the whole matter of bread-making&mdash;&ldquo;and
at last after many travailes, man&rsquo;s lyfe is fedde and
sustained therewith.&rdquo; He tells us of the use of laurel leaves
to heal bee and wasp stings and to keep books and clothes
from &ldquo;moths and other worms,&rdquo; of the making of &ldquo;fayre
images&rdquo; and of boxes wherein to keep &ldquo;spycery&rdquo; from the
wood of the box-tree. Of the making of trestle tables
&ldquo;areared and set upon feet,&rdquo; of playing boards &ldquo;that men
playe on at the dyes [dice] and other gamys. And this maner
of table is double and arrayd wyth dyerse colours.&rdquo; Of the
making of writing tables, of wood used for flooring that &ldquo;set
in solar floors serue all men and bestys y<sup>t</sup> ben therein, and
ben treden of alle men and beestys that come therein,&rdquo; and
so strong that &ldquo;they bende not nor croke [crack] whan they
ben pressyd w<sup>t</sup> heuy thynges layd on them.&rdquo; And also of
boards used for ships, bridges, hulks and coffers, and &ldquo;in
shypbreche [shipwreck] men fle to bordes and ben ofte sauyd in
peryll.&rdquo; Of the building of houses with roofs of &ldquo;trees
stretchyd from the walles up to the toppe of ye house,&rdquo; with
rafters &ldquo;stronge and square and hewen playne,&rdquo; and of &ldquo;the
covering of strawe and thetche [thatch].&rdquo; Of the making of
linen from the soaking of the flax in water till it is dried and
turned in the sun and then bound in &ldquo;praty bundels&rdquo; and
&ldquo;afterward knockyd, beten and brayd and carflyd, rodded and
gnodded; ribbyd and heklyd and at the laste sponne,&rdquo; of the
bleaching, and finally of its many uses for making clothing, and
for sails, and fish nets, and thread, and ropes, and strings (&ldquo;for
bows&rdquo;), and measuring lines, and sheets (&ldquo;to reste in&rdquo;), and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>52]</a></span>
sackes, and bagges, and purses (&ldquo;to put and to kepe thynges
in&rdquo;). Of the making of tow &ldquo;uneven and full of knobs,&rdquo; used
for stuffing into the cracks in ships, and &ldquo;for bonds and
byndynges and matches for candelles, for it is full drye and
takyth sone fyre and brenneth.&rdquo; &ldquo;And so,&rdquo; he concludes
somewhat breathlessly, &ldquo;none herbe is so nedefull to so many
dyurrse uses to mankynde as is the flexe.&rdquo; Of the vineyard
&ldquo;closyd about wyth walles and wyth hegges, with a wayte
[watch] set in an hyghe place to kepe the vynyerde that the
fruyte be not dystroyed.&rdquo; Of the desolation of the vineyard
in winter, &ldquo;but in harueste tyme many comyth and haunteth
the vynyerde.&rdquo; Of the delicious smell of a vineyard. Of the
damage done by foxes and swine and &ldquo;tame hounds.&rdquo; &ldquo;A
few hounds,&rdquo; Bartholomew tells us, &ldquo;wasten and dystroye moo
grapes that cometh and eteth therof theuylly [thievishly].&rdquo;
&ldquo;A vineyard,&rdquo; he concludes, &ldquo;maye not be kepte nother
sauyd but by his socour and helpe that all thynge hath and
possesseth in his power and myghte. And kepyth and sauyth
all lordly and myghtily.&rdquo; And is there any other writer who in
so few words tells us of the woods in those days? Of the
&ldquo;beestis and foulis&rdquo; therein as well as the herbs, of the woods
in summer-time, of the hunting therein, of the robbers and
the difficulty of finding one&rsquo;s way? Of the birds and the bees
and the wild honey and the delicious coolness of the deep shade
in summer, and the &ldquo;wery wayfarynge trauelynge men&rdquo;?
And the final brief suggestion of the time when forests were
veritable boundaries? I believe also that this is the only book
in which we are told of the interesting old custom of tying knots
to the trees &ldquo;in token and marke of ye highe waye,&rdquo; and of
robbers deliberately removing them. The picture is so perfect
that I give it in full:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;Woods ben wide places wast and desolate y<sup>t</sup> many trees
growe in w<sup>t</sup>oute fruyte and also few hauyinge fruyte. And those

In somer wodes ben bewtyed [beautied] wyth bowes and

[deceit] and of huntynge. For therin wylde beest ben hunted:

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>54]</a></span>
Bartholomew&rsquo;s book on herbs ends thus: &ldquo;And here we shall
fynysshe and ende in treatyng of the XVII boke whyche hath
treated as ye may openly knowe of suche thynges as the Maker
of all thyng hath ordered and brought forth by his myghty
power to embelyssh and araye the erthe wyth and most specyally
for ye fode of man and beast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the end of the book is the poem which has caused so
much controversy amongst bibliographers. In this Wynken de
Worde definitely states that Caxton had a share in the first
printing of this book at Cologne:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;And also of your charyte call to remembraunce<br /></span>

<span class="i1">That every well disposed man may therein loke.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>In spite of this, modern bibliographers are of opinion that
Caxton could not have played even a subordinate part in the
printing of this book at Cologne.</p>

<p>De Worde also refers to the maker of the paper<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>:&mdash;</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>There is charm as well as pathos in the verses on the reproduction
of manuscripts in book form, showing us vividly what
the recent discovery of the art of printing meant to the scholars
of that day. The simile of Ph&oelig;bus &ldquo;repairing&rdquo; the moon is
very apt.</p>

</div>

<p>The treatise on herbs formed, as we have seen, only a part
of Bartholomew&rsquo;s <i>De Proprietatibus Rerum</i>, and, to speak strictly,
the first printed English herbal was the small quarto volume
published by Richard Banckes in 1525. It was the beginning
of a series of small books<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> chiefly in black letter. All of them,
though issued from different presses, have nearly the same title,
and they vary only slightly from the original <i>Banckes&rsquo;s Herbal</i>.
The title of this Herbal is&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;Here begynneth a new mater / the whiche sheweth and |
treateth of ye vertues &amp; proprytes of her- | bes / the whiche is
called | an Herball &#729;.&#729; | &para; Cum gratia &amp; priuilegio | a rege indulto |</p>

<p>&ldquo;(<i>Colophon</i>) &para; Imprynted by me Rycharde Banckes / dwellynge
in | L&#333;d&#333; / a lytel fro ye Stockes in ye Pultry / ye XXV day
of | Marche. The yere of our Lorde MCCCCC. &amp; XXV.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>We do not know who the author of this book was, and it
has been suggested that it is based on some medi&aelig;val English
manuscript now lost. Certainly when one reads this anonymous
work known as <i>Banckes&rsquo;s Herbal</i> one is struck not only by its
superiority to the later and more famous <i>Grete Herball</i>, but
also by its greater charm. It gives the impression of being a
compilation from various sources, the author having made his
own selection from what pleased him most in the older English
manuscript herbals. It seems to have been a labour of love,
whereas the <i>Grete Herball</i> is merely a translation. It is almost
certain that the writer made use of one of the numerous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>56]</a></span>
manuscript versions of Macer&rsquo;s Herbal, which in parts <i>Banckes&rsquo;s
Herbal</i> resembles very closely, and the chapter on rosemary
shows that he had access to one of the copies of the manuscript
on the virtues of rosemary which was sent by the Countess of
Hainault to Queen Philippa. He does not give the beautiful
old tradition preserved in that manuscript,<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> but he ascribes
wonderful virtues to this herb, with the same loving enthusiasm
and almost in the same words. Of rosemary in <i>Banckes&rsquo;s
Herbal</i> we read:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;Take the flowers thereof and make powder thereof and
binde it to thy right arme in a linnen cloath and it shale make

<p>That <i>Banckes&rsquo;s Herbal</i> achieved immediate popularity is
attested by the fact that the following year another edition of
it was issued, and during the next thirty years various London
printers issued the same book under different titles.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> Robert
Wyer<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> ascribed the authorship of those he issued to Macer,
and in the edition of 1530 he added, after &ldquo;Macer&rsquo;s Herbal,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Practysed by Dr. Lynacro.&rdquo; Whether this statement is true
it is impossible to discover, but we know that the great doctor
died some years before Wyer set up as a printer, and his name
does not appear in any of the subsequent editions of the herbal
issued by other printers. In Wyer&rsquo;s edition there are some good
initial letters very similar to those used by Wynkyn de Worde.</p>

<p>The most interesting edition of the herbal is that printed
by William Copland, in which first appear the additional chapters
on &ldquo;The virtues of waters stylled,&rdquo; &ldquo;The tyme of gathering
of sedes&rdquo; and &ldquo;A general rule of all maner of herbes.&rdquo; He
issued two editions bearing the same title and differing only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>58]</a></span>
in the woodcuts and the colophon. The title is &ldquo;A boke of
the | propreties of Herbes called an her- | ball, whereunto is
added the tyme y<sup>e</sup> | herbes, floures and Sedes shold | be gathered
to be kept the whole, ye- | re, with the vertue of ye Herbes wh&#275; |
they are stylled. Al- | so a generall rule of all ma- | ner of Herbes
drawen | out of an auncyent | booke of Phisyck | by W.&nbsp;C.&rdquo;
The woodcut in the first edition is three &ldquo;Tudor&rdquo; roses in a
double circle with a crown over one of the roses and across the
riband &ldquo;K&#563;ge of floures.&rdquo; In the second edition the woodcut
is a quaint little representation of a lady seated in a garden.
One man standing behind her is holding her and another is
walking towards her. The three figures are near a wall, on
the other side of which several men are apparently conversing.
Who W.&nbsp;C. was is uncertain. In the <i>Dictionary of National
Biography</i> William Copland is said to be both the author and
the printer of the book, but in many catalogues (notably in
that of the British Museum) Walter Cary figures as the author.
In a lengthy account of the Carys in <i>Notes and Queries</i> (March 29,
1913) Mr. A.&nbsp;L. Humphreys disposes conclusively of the supposition
that W.&nbsp;C. can stand for Walter Cary.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;<i>A Boke of the Properties of Herbes</i> bears on the title-page
the initials W.&nbsp;C., which may stand either for Copland or Cary.
This was one of several editions of <i>Banckes&rsquo;s Herbal</i>, then very
popular, and although it may have been edited or promoted
in some way by a Walter Cary, it could not have been by the
one who wrote <i>The Hammer for the Stone</i>. The &lsquo;Herball&rsquo;
was issued somewhere about 1550 and various editions of it
exist, but all these appeared when the Walter Cary we are
considering was a child. There is, however, a connection
between the Carys and herbals, because it is well known that
Henry Lyte (1529-1607) of Lytes Cary was the famous translator
of Dodoens&rsquo;s <i>Herball</i> (1578), and he had a herbal garden at Lytes
Cary.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Ames in his <i>Typographical Antiquities</i> describes the two
editions, which are identical, as though they were two different
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>59]</a></span>
books, and ascribes one to Walter Cary and the other to William
Copland. We have only Ames&rsquo;s authority for the supposition
that Copland was the compiler as well as the printer. The
herbal in question is merely another edition of <i>Banckes&rsquo;s Herbal</i>,
but it is quite possible that the three additional chapters at the
end were &ldquo;drawen out of an auncyent booke of Physick&rdquo;
by Copland.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>Two editions of <i>Banckes&rsquo;s Herbal</i> are ascribed, on account of
the wording of the title, to Antony Askham, and the title is so
attractive that it is a disappointment to find that the astrological
additions &ldquo;declaryng what herbes hath influence of certain
sterres and constellations,&rdquo; etc., do not appear in any known
copy of the herbal. This astrological lore from the famous man
who combined the professions of priest, physician and astrologer
in the reign of Edward VI. would be of remarkable interest.
But it has been pointed out by Mr. H.&nbsp;M. Barlow<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> that, if the
bibliographers who have attributed the work to Askham had
examined the title of the work with greater care, they would
have observed that the phrase &ldquo;by Anthonye Askham&rdquo; refers
not to the substance of the book itself (which is merely another
edition of <i>Banckes&rsquo;s Herbal</i>) but to the &ldquo;Almanacke&rdquo; from which
the additions were intended to be taken, though apparently
they were never printed. The title of &ldquo;Askham&rsquo;s&rdquo; Herbal is&mdash;</p>

<p>There are some charming prescriptions to be found in
&ldquo;Askham&rsquo;s&rdquo; Herbal. Under &ldquo;rose,&rdquo; for instance, we have
recipes for &ldquo;melroset,&rdquo; &ldquo;sugar roset,&rdquo; &ldquo;syrope of Rooses,&rdquo;
&ldquo;oyle of roses&rdquo; and &ldquo;rose water.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;Melrosette is made thus. Take faire purified honye and
new read rooses, the whyte endes of them clypped awaye, th&#257;
chop theym smal and put th&#275; into the Hony and boyl th&#275; menely
together; to know whan it is boyled ynoughe, ye shal know
it by the swete odour and the colour read. Fyve yeares he may
be kept in his vertue; by the Roses he hath vertue of comfortinge
and by the hony he hath vertu of clensinge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Syrope of Rooses is made thus. Some do take roses dyght
as it is sayd and boyle them in water and in the water strayned
thei put suger and make a sirope thereof; and some do make it
better, for they put roses in a vessell, hauing a strayght mouthe,
and they put to the roses hote water and thei let it stande
a day and a night and of that water, putting to it suger, thei
do make sirope, and some doe put more of Roses in the forsaid
vessel and more of hote water, and let it stande as is beforesaide,
and so they make a read water and make the rose syrope.
And some do st&#257;pe new Roses and then strayne out the joyce
of it and suger therwyth, they make sirope: and this is the best
making of sirope. In Wynter and in Somer it maye be geuen
competently to feble sicke mel&#257;coly and colorike people.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sugar Roset is made thus&mdash;Take newe gathered roses and
st&#257;pe them righte smal with sugar, th&#257; put in a glasse XXX.
dayes, let it stande in ye sunne and stirre it wel, and medle it
well together so it may be kept three yeares in his vertue. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>61]</a></span>
qu&#257;titie of sugar and roses should be thus. In IIII. pound of
sugar a pounde of roses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oyle of roses is made thus. Some boyle roses in oyle
and kepe it, some do fyll a glasse with roses and oyle and they
boyle it in a caudron full of water and this oyle is good. Some
stampe fresh roses with oyle and they put it in a vessel of glasse
and set it in the s&#363;ne IIII. dais and this oyle is good.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rose water. Some do put rose water in a glass and they
put roses with their dew therto and they make it to boile in
water th&#257; thei set it in the sune tyll it be readde and this water
is beste.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Under the same flower we find this fragrant example of the
widespread medi&aelig;val belief in the efficacy of good smells:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;Also drye roses put to ye nose to smell do c&#333;forte the braine
and the harte and quencheth sprite.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>The herbalists were never weary of teaching the value of
sweet scents.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> &ldquo;If odours may worke satisfaction,&rdquo; wrote
Gerard in his <i>Herball</i>, &ldquo;they are so soveraigne in plants and so
comfortable that no confection of the apothecaries can equall
their excellent vertue.&rdquo; One of the most delicious &ldquo;scent&rdquo;
prescriptions in Askham is to be found under Violet&mdash;&ldquo;For
th&#275; that may not slepe for sickness seeth this herb in water
and at euen let him soke well hys feete in the water to the ancles,
wh&#257; he goeth to bed, bind of this herbe to his temples and he
shall slepe wel by the grace of God.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The most curious recipe is that under &ldquo;woodbinde.&rdquo; &ldquo;Go
to the roote of woodbinde and make a hole in the middes of
the roote, than cover it well againe y<sup>t</sup> no ayre go out nor that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>62]</a></span>
no rayne go in, no water, nor earth nor the sune come not to
much to it, let it stande so a night and a day, th&#257; after that go
to it and thou shalt fynde therein a certayne lycoure. Take
out that lycoure with a spone and put it into a clean glas and
do so every day as long as thou fyndest ought in the hole, and
this must be done in the moneth of April or Maye, than anoynt
the sore therwith against the fyre, th&#257; wete a lynnen clothe
in the same lycoure and lappe it about the sore and it shal be
hole in shorte space on warrantyse by the Grace of God.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Unlike the later <i>Grete Herball</i>, Askham gives some descriptions
of the herbs themselves, notably in the case of alleluia
(wood-sorrel), water crowfoot, and asterion.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;This herbe alleluia m&#275; call it Wodsour or Stubwort, this
herbe hath thre leaves ye which be ro&#363;d a litel departed aboue
and it hath a whyte flour, but it hath no l&#333;ge stalkes and it
is Woodsoure and it is like thre leued grasse. The vertue of
this herbe is thus, if it be rosted in the ashes in red docke leaves
or in red wort leaves it fretteth awai dead flesh of a wounde.
This herbe groweth much in woodes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Water crowfoot: &ldquo;This herb that men call water crowfoot
hath yelow floures, as hath crowfoot and of the same shap,
but the leves are more departed as it were Rammes fete, and it
hath a long stalke and out of that one stalke groweth many
stalkes smal by ye sides. This herb groweth in watery places.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Asterion or Lunary groweth among stoones and in high
places, this herb shyneth by night and he bringeth forth purple
floures hole and rounde as a knockebell or else lyke to foxgloves,
the leves of this herbe be rounde and blew and they have the
mark of the Moone in the myddes as it were thre leved grasse,
but the leaves therof be more and they be round as a peny.
And the stalk of this herb is red and thyse herb semeth as it
were musk and the joyce therof is yelow and this groweth in
the new Moone without leve and euery day spryngeth a newe
leaue to the ende of fyftene dayes and after fyftene dayes it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>63]</a></span>
looseth euery day a leaue as the Moone waneth and it springeth
and waneth as doth the Moone and where that it groweth there
groweth great quantitie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The vertue of this herbe is thus&mdash;thei that eat of the
beris or of the herbe in waning of the moone, wh&#257; he is in signo
virginis if he have the falling euell he shal be hole thereof or if
he beare thys about his neck he shal be holpen without doute.
And it hath many more vertues than I can tell at this tyme.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>One of the unidentified herbs is called &ldquo;sene,&rdquo; and we are
given the somewhat vague geographical information, &ldquo;It groweth
in the other syde the sea and moste aboute Babilon.&rdquo;</p>


<p class="hrpad">Another small book printed by William Copland must be
mentioned, for, although it is not a herbal, it contains a great
deal of curious herb lore not to be found elsewhere. This is
<i>The boke of secretes of Albartus Magnus of the vertues of
Herbes, Stones, and certaine beastes</i>. Who the author was is
unknown, but he was certainly not Albert of Bollstadt (1193-1280),
Bishop of Ratisbon, the scholastic philosopher to whom
it was ascribed, probably in order to increase its sale. There
is one philosophical remark which is not unworthy of the famous
Bishop: &ldquo;Every man despiseth ye thyng whereof he knoweth
nothynge and that hath done no pleasure to him.&rdquo; But for
the most part it deals with the popular beliefs concerning the
mystical properties of herbs, stones and animals.</p>

<p>Of celandine the writer tells us: &ldquo;This hearbe springeth
in the time in ye which the swallowes and also ye Eagles maketh
theyr nestes. If any man shal have this herbe with ye harte
of a Molle (mole) he shall overcome all his enemies.... And
if the before named hearbe be put upon the headde of a sycke
man if he should dye he shal syng anone with a loud voyce, if
not he shall weep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perwynke when it is beat&#275; unto pouder with wormes of
ye earth wrapped aboute it and with an herbe called houslyke
it induceth love between man and wyfe if it bee used in their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>64]</a></span>
meales ... if the sayde confection be put in the fyre it shall
be turned anone unto blue coloure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of the herb which, he tells us, &ldquo;the men of Chaldea called
roybra,&rdquo; he says: &ldquo;He that holdeth this herbe in hys h&#257;de with
an herbe called Mylfoyle or yarowe or noseblede is sure from all
feare and fantasye or vysion. And yf it be put with the juyce
of houselyke and the bearers hands be anoynted with it and the
residue be put in water if he entre in ye water where fyshes
be they wil gather together to hys handes ... and if hys hande
be draw&#275; forth they will leape agayne to theyre owne places
where they were before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of hound&rsquo;s tongue: &ldquo;If ye shall have the aforenamed herbe
under thy formost toe al the dogges shall kepe silence and shall
not have power to bark. And if thou shalt put the aforesayde
thinge in the necke of any dogge so y<sup>t</sup> he maye not touche it
with his mouthe he shalbe turned always round about lyke a
turning whele untill he fall unto the grounde as dead and this
hath bene proved in our tyme.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of centaury: &ldquo;If it be joyned with the bloude of a female
lapwing or black plover and be put with oyle in a lampe, all
they that compasse it aboute shal beleue themselves to be
witches so that one shall beleve of an other that his head is
in heaven and his fete in the earth. And if the aforesaid thynge
be put in the fire whan the starres shine it shall appeare y<sup>t</sup> the
sterres runne one agaynste another and fyght.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of vervain: &ldquo;This herbe (as witches say) gathered, the
sunne beyng in the signe of the Ram, and put with grayne or
corne of pyonie of one yeare olde healeth them y<sup>t</sup> be sicke of
ye falling sykenes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of powder of roses: &ldquo;If the aforesayde poulder be put
in a lampe and after be kindled all men shall appeare blacke as
the deuell. And if the aforesaid poulder be mixed with oyle
of the olyue tree and with quycke brymstone and the house
anointed wyth it, the Sunne shyning, it shall appeare all
inflamed.&rdquo;</p>

Of verbena: &ldquo;Infants bearing it shalbe very apte to learne
and louing learnynge and they shalbe glad and joyous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is the only book on the virtues of herbs in which I have
found a recipe to revive drowning flies and bees! This is to be
done by placing them in warm ashes of pennyroyal, and then
&ldquo;they shall recover their lyfe after a little tyme as by ye space
of one houre.&rdquo; The book ends with a curious philosophical
dissertation, &ldquo;Of the mervels of the worlde,&rdquo; which is followed
by a series of charms&mdash;to stop a cock crowing, to make men look
as though they had no heads, to obtain rule over all birds, to
keep flies away from a house, to write letters which can only be
read at night, to make men look as though they had &ldquo;the
countenance of a dog,&rdquo; to make men seem as though they had
three heads, to understand the language of birds, to make men
seem like angels, and to put things in the fire without their
being consumed.</p>


<p class="hrpad">Though lacking in the charm of the quaint and typically
English <i>Banckes&rsquo;s Herbal</i>, the most famous of the early printed
herbals was the <i>Grete Herball</i> printed by Peter Treveris in 1526.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

</div>

<p>According to the introduction it was compiled from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>66]</a></span>
works of &ldquo;many noble doctoures and experte maysters in
medecines, as Auicenna, Pandecta, Constantinus, Wilhelmus,
Platearius, Rabbi Moyses, Johannes Mesue, Haly, Albertus,
Bartholomeus and more other.&rdquo; But with the exception of
the preface the <i>Grete Herball</i> is a translation of the well-known
French herbal, <i>Le Grant Herbier</i>. Until about 1886 <i>Le Grant
Herbier</i> was supposed to be a translation of the <i>Herbarius zu
Teutsch</i>, published at Mainz in 1485, or of the <i>Ortus Sanitatis</i>,
printed also at Mainz in 1491.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> The <i>Herbarius zu Teutsch</i>, which
was probably compiled by a Frankfort physician, is a fine herbal
beautifully illustrated, and the later <i>Ortus Sanitatis</i> is by some
authorities supposed to be a Latin translation of it. To judge from
the preface to the German Herbarius it was a labour of love,
undertaken by a man who apparently was possessed of ample
wealth and leisure; for in his preface he tells us that he &ldquo;caused
this praiseworthy work to be begun by a Master learned in
physic,&rdquo; and then, finding that as many of the herbs did not
grow in his native land he could not draw them &ldquo;with their
true colours and form,&rdquo; he left the work unfinished and journeyed
through many lands&mdash;Italy, Croatia, Albania, Dalmatia, Greece,
Corfu, Candia, Rhodes, Cyprus, the Holy Land, Arabia, Babylonia
and Egypt. He was accompanied by &ldquo;a painter ready of
wit and cunning and subtle of hand,&rdquo; and was thus able to have
the herbs &ldquo;truly drawn.&rdquo; The book he compiled on his return
was long regarded as the original of the French herbal, <i>Le Grant
Herbier</i>, but in 1866 Professor Giulio Camus found two fifteenth-century
manuscripts in the Biblioteca Estense at Modena, one
the Latin work commonly known from the opening words
as <i>Circa Instans</i>, and the other a French translation of the same
manuscript. It was always supposed by medical historians
that the <i>Circa Instans</i> was written by Matthaeus Platearius of
Salerno in the twelfth century, but in Professor Camus&rsquo;s memoir,
<i>L&rsquo;Op&eacute;ra Saleritana &ldquo;Circa Instans&rdquo; ed il testo primitivo del
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>67]</a></span>
&ldquo;Grand Herbier in Francoys&rdquo; secundo duo codici del secolo XV
conservati nella Regia Biblioteca Estense</i>, there are reproduced
the French verses in which occurs the line, &ldquo;Il a est&eacute; escript
Millccc cinquante et huit,&rdquo; and Mr. H.&nbsp;M. Barlow<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> supports
the deduction that <i>Circa Instans</i> was not written by a Salernitan
physician, but by a writer described in the verses as &ldquo;Bartholomaeus
minid&rsquo; senis&rdquo; in 1458. <i>Le Grant Herbier</i>, of which
the English <i>Grete Herball</i> is a translation, is a version of the French
manuscript translation of <i>Circa Instans</i>, and therefore, as <i>Circa
Instans</i> is older than either the <i>Herbarius zu Teutsch</i> or the Latin
<i>Ortus Sanitatis</i>, it would seem that it is the real original of our
<i>Grete Herball</i>. The preface to the <i>Grete Herball</i>, however, bears
a strong resemblance to that of the German Herbarius, of which
I quote a part from Dr. Arber&rsquo;s translation, made from the
second (Augsburg) edition of 1485. They have been placed in
parallel columns to show how closely the English preface follows
that of the German Herbarius.</p>

    <td class="tdl">
&ldquo;Many a time and oft have I contemplated<br />
inwardly the wondrous<br />
works of the creator of the universe:<br />
how in the beginning He formed<br />
the heavens and adorned them with<br />
goodly shining stars, to which he<br />
gave power and might to influence<br />
everything under heaven. Also how<br />
he afterwards formed the four elements:<br />
fire, hot and dry&mdash;air, hot<br />
and moist&mdash;water, cold and moist&mdash;earth,<br />
dry and cold&mdash;and gave to<br />
each a nature of its own; and how<br />
after this the same Great Master of<br />
Nature made and formed herbs of<br />
many sorts and animals of all kinds<br />
and last of all Man, the noblest of<br />
all created things. Thereupon I<br />
thought on the wondrous order which<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>68]</a></span>
the Creator gave these same creatures<br />
of His, so that everything which<br />
has its being under heaven receives<br />
it from the stars and keeps it by<br />
their help. I considered further how<br />
that in everything which arises, grows,<br />
lives or soars in the four elements<br />
named, be it metal, stone, herb or<br />
animal, the four natures of the elements,<br />
heat, cold, moistness and<br />
dryness, are mingled. It is also to<br />
be noted that the four natures in<br />
question are also mixed and blended<br />
in the human body in a measure and<br />
temperament suitable to the life and<br />
nature of man; while man keeps<br />
within this measure ... he is strong<br />
and healthy, but as soon as he steps<br />
or falls beyond ... which happens<br />
when heat takes the upper hand and<br />
strives to stifle cold or on the contrary<br />
when cold begins to suppress<br />
heat ... he falls of necessity into<br />
sickness and draws nigh unto death.<br />
... Of a truth I would as soon count<br />
the leaves on the trees or the grains<br />
of sand in the sea as the things<br />
which are the causes of man&rsquo;s sickness.<br />
It is for this reason that so<br />
many thousands and thousands of<br />
perils and dangers beset man. He is<br />
not fully sure of his health or his<br />
life for one moment. While considering<br />
these matters, I also remembered<br />
how the Creator of Nature,<br />
who has placed us amid such dangers<br />
has mercifully provided us with a<br />
remedy, that is with all kinds of<br />
herbs, animals and other created<br />
things.... By virtue of these herbs<br />
and created things the sick man may<br />
recover the temperament of the four<br />
elements and the health of his body.<br />
Since then man can have no greater<br />
nor nobler treasure on earth than<br />
bodily health, I came to the conclusion<br />
that I could not perform any<br />
more useful and holy work than to<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>69]</a></span>
compile a book in which could be<br />
contained the virtue and nature of<br />
many herbs and other created things,<br />
together with their true colours and<br />
for the help of all the world, and the<br />
common good, therefore I caused<br />
this praiseworthy work to be begun<br />
by a Master learned in physic who,<br />
at my request gathered into a book<br />
the nature and virtue of many herbs<br />
out of the acknowledged masters of<br />
physic, Galen, Avicenna, Serapio,<br />
Dioscorides, Pandectarius, Platearius<br />

<p>The illustrations in the <i>Grete Herball</i> are poor, being merely
inferior copies of those in the later editions of the <i>Herbarius zu
Teutsch</i>.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> In the majority of cases it is impossible to identify
the plant from the figure, and the same figure is sometimes
prefixed to different plants. But if the illustrations are poor
and dull the frontispiece and the full-page woodcut of the
printer&rsquo;s mark are very much the reverse. The frontispiece is
a charming woodcut of a man holding a spade in his right hand
and gathering grapes, and a woman throwing flowers and herbs
out of her apron into a basket. There are two figures in the
lower corners, the one of a male and the other of a female mandrake.
The woodcut of the printer&rsquo;s mark at the end sheds
an interesting ray of light on the Peter Treveris who issued the
two first editions of this Herball.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> The woodcut represents
two wodows<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> (savages), a man and a woman, on either side
of a tree, from which is suspended a shield with Peter Treveris&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>70]</a></span>
initials. Ames supposes that Treveris was a native of Tr&egrave;ves
and took his name from that city, but it is more likely that he
was a member of the Cornish family of Treffry, which is sometimes
spelt Treveris. A Sir John Treffry, who fought at Poitiers, took
as supporters to his arms a wild man and woman, and one likes
to find that one of his descendants perpetuated the memory
of his gallant ancestor by adopting the same sign for his trade
device.</p>

<p>The <i>Grete Herball</i> is alphabetically arranged, for the idea
of the natural relationship of plants was unknown at that
time. But we find a &ldquo;classification&rdquo; of fungi. &ldquo;Fungi ben
musherons. There be two maners of them, one maner is deadly
and sleeth them that eateth of them and the other dooth not&rdquo;!
As in most sixteenth-&nbsp;and seventeenth-century herbals, there
are quaint descriptions of a good many things besides herbs.
The most gruesome of these is a substance briefly described as
&ldquo;mummy,&rdquo; and the accompanying illustration is of a man
digging beside a tomb. &ldquo;Mummy,&rdquo; one reads, &ldquo;is a maner of
spyces or confectyons that is founde in the sepulchres or tombes
of dead bodyes that haue be confyct with spyces. And it is
to wyte that in olde tyme men were wont to confyct the deed
corpses and anoynte them with bawme and myre smellynge
swete. And yet ye paynims about babylon kepe that custome
for there is grete quantity of bawme. And this mummye is
specially founde about the brayne and about the maronge in
the rydge bone. For the blode by reason of the bawme draweth
to the brayne and thereabout is chauffed. And lykewise is the
brayne brent and parched and is the quantyte of mommye and
so the blode is mroeued in the rydge of the backe. That mommye
is to be chosen that is bryght blacke stynkynge and styffe.
And that y<sup>t</sup> is whyt and draweth to a dymme colour and that
is not stynkynge nor styffe, and that powdreth lightly is naught.
It hath vertue to restrayne or staunche.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

Other substances described are salt, cheese, pitch, lead,
silver, gold, amber, water, starch, vinegar, butter, honey and
the lodestone. The dissertation on water shows very clearly
that our ancestors regarded bathing as a fad, and a dangerous
fad at that. The writer gloomily observes, &ldquo;many folke that
hath bathed them in colde water haue dyed or they came home.&rdquo;
And those who are foolish enough to drink water he warns by
quoting the authority of &ldquo;Mayster Isaac,&rdquo; who &ldquo;sayth that
it is impossible for them that drynketh overmuche water in
theyr youth to come to ye age that God hath ordeyned them.&rdquo;
In the description of the lodestone we find the well-known
popular belief about ships being drawn to their destruction.
&ldquo;The lodestone, the adamant stone that draweth yren hath
myghte to draw yren as Aristotle sayth. And is founde in the
brymmes of the occyan see. And there be hillis of it and these
hyllis drawe ye shippes that haue nayles of yren to them and
breke the shyppes by drawynge of the nayles out.&rdquo; The accompanying
illustration is of a sinking ship with a man going
towards the hill of adamant with uplifted hands, while another
man is swimming, and a third sits calmly in the ship.</p>

<p>In view of the free use of honey in olden times, the account
of honey in the <i>Grete Herball</i> seems inadequate. &ldquo;Hony is
made by artyfyce and craft of bees. The whyche bees draweth
the thynnest parte of the floures and partelye of the thickest
and moost grosse and thereof maketh hony and waxe and also
they make a substaunce that is called the honycombe. The
tame hony is that that is made in the hous or hyues that labourers
ordeyneth for the sayd bees to lodge and worke in. Hony is
whyte in cold places and browne in warm place. And hony
ought to be put in medicyne and may be kept C yeeres. There
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>72]</a></span>
is an other that is called wylde hony and is found in woodes
and is not so good as the other and is more bytter. Also there
is a honey called castanea because it is made of chestayne
floures that the bees sucketh and is bytter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the <i>Grete Herball</i>, as in <i>Banckes&rsquo;s Herball</i>, we find numerous
instances of the use of herbs as amulets or for their effect on
the mind, and for the smoking of patients with their fumes.
I quote the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;Betony. For them that be ferfull. For them that ben
to ferfull gyue two dragmes of powdre hereof wt warme water
and as moche wyne at the tyme that the fere cometh.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Buglos. To preserve the mynde. This herbe often eaten
confermeth and conserueth the mynde as many wyse maysters
sayth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To make folke mery. Take the water that buglos hath
b&#275; soden in and sprynkle it about the hous or chambre and all
that be therein shall be mery.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vervain. To make folke mery at ye table. To make all
them in a hous to be mery take foure leaves and foure rotes
of vervayn in wyne, than spryncle the wine all about the hous
where the eatynge is and they shall be all mery.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Musk. Agaynst weyknesse of the brayne smel to
musk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Struci&#363;n. Against lytargye blowe the powdre of the sede
in to the nose or elles sethe the sede thereof and juice of rue
in stronge vyneygre and rubbe the hynder parte of ye head
therwith.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Artemisia. To make a child mery hange a bondell of
mugwort or make smoke thereof under the chylde&rsquo;s bedde for
it taketh away annoy for hem.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rosemary. For weyknesse of ye brayne. Agaynst weyknesse
of the brayne and coldenesse thereof, sethe rosmarin in
wyne and lete the pacyent receye the smoke at his nose and kepe
his heed warme.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>73]</a></span>
&ldquo;Southernwood. The fume of it expelleth all serpents out
of the house and what so ever there abydeth dyeth.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>There are two delicious violet recipes for &ldquo;Syrope of Vyolettes&rdquo;
and &ldquo;oyle of vyolettes.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;Syrope of vyolettes &#299; made in this maner&mdash;Sethe vyolettes
in water and lete it lye all nyght in ye same water. Than poure
and streyne out the water, and in the same put sugre and make
your syrope.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oyle of vyolettes is made thus. Sethe vyolettes in oyle
and streyne it. It will be oyle of vyolettes.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>It is in this herbal that we find the first avowal of disbelief
in the supposed powers of the mandrake.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;There be two maners the male and the female, the female
hath sharpe leves. Some say that it is better for medycyne
than the male but we use of bothe. Some say that the male
hath figure of shape of a man. And the female of a woman
but that is fals. For Nature never gaue forme or shape of
m&#257;kynde to an herbe. But it is of troughe that some hath
shaped suche fygures by craft as we have fortyme herde say of
labourers in the feldes.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>The <i>Grete Herball</i> ends thus&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

The only important books Treveris published besides the
<i>Grete Herball</i> were the two English translations of Hieronymus
Braunschweig&rsquo;s works (<i>The noble experyence of the virtuous
Handy-worke of Surgeri</i> and <i>The vertuouse Book of the
Dystillacion of the Waters of all maner of Herbes</i>) and the
handsome edition of Trevisa&rsquo;s translation of Higden&rsquo;s <i>Polychronicon</i>.
<i>The vertuouse Book of the Dystillacion of the Waters
of all maner of Herbes</i> is well printed, but the illustrations
are from the same inferior German cuts as those in the <i>Grete
Herball</i>. The book was translated into English by Laurence
Andrew and, though strictly it does not come within the category
of herbals, part of the preface is too beautiful to omit. &ldquo;Lerne
the hygh and meruelous vertue of herbes. Knowe how inestimable
a preservative to the helth of man god hath provyded
growying euery daye at our hande, use the effectes with reverence,

He is sometimes erroneously called Bartholomew de Glanville. Leland,
without citing any authority, called him de Glanville. Bale copied Leland in
1557 and added a list of writings wrongly attributed to Bartholomew. Qu&eacute;tif
and Echard give detailed reasons in pointing out Leland&rsquo;s error. The Parmese
chronicler, Salimbene, writing in 1283, refers to him as Bartholom&aelig;us Anglicus,
and John de Trittenheim, Abbot of Sparheim (end of fifteenth century), speaks
of him as &ldquo;Bartholomeus natione Anglicus.&rdquo; M. Leopold Delisle endeavoured
to claim him as a Frenchman, but although he spent the greater part of his
life abroad, he was always distinguished as &ldquo;Bartholom&aelig;us Anglicus.&rdquo; That
he was a Minorite &ldquo;de provincia Francia&rdquo; is no proof that he was a Frenchman.
Batman (1582), on the authority of Bale, describes Bartholom&aelig;us as
being &ldquo;of the noble familie of the Earles of Suffolk.&rdquo;</p>

Robert Wyer was one of the most famous printers of the early sixteenth
century. He came of a Buckinghamshire family and was probably a near
relation of John Wyer, also a printer who lived in Fleet Street, for both of
them used the device of St. John the Evangelist. He served his apprenticeship
to Richard Pynson, whose printing press was in the rentals of Norwich House
near the site of the present Villiers Street, and on Pynson&rsquo;s death succeeded
to the business. In both his editions of the herbal there is his well-known
device of St. John the Evangelist bareheaded and dressed in a flowing robe,
sitting under a tree on an island and writing on a scroll spread over his right
knee. At his right hand is an eagle with outstretched wings holding an inkwell
in its beak, and in the background are the towers and spires of a great city.</p>

The popular belief in the power of sweet-smelling herbs to ward off
infection of the much-dreaded plague rose to its height in Charles II.&rsquo;s reign,
when bunches of rosemary were sold for six and eightpence. Till recently
there were at least two survivals of this belief in herbal scents&mdash;the doctor&rsquo;s
gold-headed cane (formerly a pomander carried at the end of a cane) and the
little bouquets carried by the clergy at the distribution of the Maundy Money
in Westminster Abbey.</p>

The use of &ldquo;mummy&rdquo; is not only mentioned by all the later herbalists
up to the end of the seventeenth century, but is even to be found in MS. still-room
books. In the Fairfax still-room book a recipe for wounds said to have
been procured from &ldquo;Rodolphus Goclerius, professor of Phisicke in Wittenburghe,&rdquo;
begins thus: &ldquo;Take of the moss of a strangled man 2 ounces, of the

<p>&ldquo;In the beginning of winter the Goldfinches use muche to haunte this
herbe [teazle] for the sedes sake whereof they are very desyrous.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Turner&rsquo;s
Herbal</i>, 1551.</p>
</div>


<p>Like so many sixteenth-century notabilities, William Turner,
commonly known as the father of English botany, was remarkably
versatile, for he was a divine, a physician and a botanist.
He was a native of Morpeth, Northumberland, and was born in
Henry VIII.&rsquo;s reign: the exact date is unknown. His father is
supposed to have been a tanner. We know nothing of his
early education, but he entered what is now Pembroke College,<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>
Cambridge, under the patronage of Thomas Lord Wentworth.
This he himself tells us in the preface to the second part of his
herbal, which is dedicated to Lord Wentworth of the next
generation. &ldquo;And who hath deserved better to have my booke
of herbs to be given to him, than he, whose father with his
yearly exhibition did helpe me, beying student in Cambridge of
Physik and philosophy? Whereby with some further help and
study am commed to this pore knowledge of herbes and other
simples that I have. Wherefore I dedicate unto you this my
litle boke, desyring you to defende it against the envious evil
speakers, which can alow nothing but that they do themselves:
and the same I give unto your Lordship, beseeching to take it
in the stede of a better thyng, and for a token of my good will
toward you, and all your father&rsquo;s houshold, which thing if ye
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>76]</a></span>
do, as sonne as I shall have convenient lesure, ye shall have the
third and last parte of my herball also. Almighty God kepe
you and all youres. Amen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At Cambridge Turner was intimate with Nicholas Ridley
(afterwards the famous Bishop of London), and though it is
interesting to know that Ridley instructed him in Greek, it
is even more attractive to learn that the future bishop also
initiated him into the mysteries of tennis and archery. Turner
did well at the university, for he was elected Junior Fellow of
his college in 1531 and Joint Treasurer in 1532, and he had a
title for Orders in 1537. Throughout his life he was a staunch
Protestant and at Cambridge he used to attend the preachings
of Hugh Latimer. We do not know how long Turner held his
fellowship, possibly till his marriage with Jane, daughter of
George Ander, Alderman of Cambridge. He left Cambridge in
1540 and travelled about, preaching in various places. In
Wood&rsquo;s <i>Athen&aelig; Oxonienses</i> we read, &ldquo;In his rambles he settled
for a time in Oxon among several of his countrymen that he
found there, purposely for the conversation of men and
books.... At the same time and after, following his old trade
of preaching without a call, he was imprisoned for a considerable
time.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> On his release he left England and travelled in Italy,
Germany and Holland. He tells us in his herbal that he visited
Cremona, Como, Milan, Venice and Chiavenna, and at Bologna<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
he studied botany under Luca Ghini. Either there or at Ferrara
he took his M.D. degree. From Italy he went to Zurich, where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>77]</a></span>
he formed his intimate and lifelong friendship with Conrad
Gesner,<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> the famous Swiss naturalist.</p>

<p>He subsequently visited Basle and Cologne, and it was in
these two cities that his small religious books upholding the
Protestant cause were printed. They were very popular in
England, so much so that in the last year of Henry VIII.&rsquo;s
reign they were prohibited. Turner spent some time botanising
in the Rhine country: in his herbal he speaks of different
plants which he collected at Bonn, Basel, Bingen, Cologne,
&ldquo;Erenffelde&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sieburg.&rdquo; Then he went to Holland and
East Friesland&mdash;the latter he frequently mentions&mdash;and became
physician to the &ldquo;Erle of Emden.&rdquo; It was probably at this
time that he explored the islands off the mainland. He was
in correspondence with &ldquo;Maister Riche and maister Morgan,
Apotecaries of London,&rdquo; two names which, it is interesting to
note, occur also in de l&rsquo;Obel&rsquo;s works and in Gerard&rsquo;s Herbal.</p>

<p>Turner wrote the first part of his Herbal when he was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>78]</a></span>
abroad, but he delayed publication until the conclusion of his
wanderings. On his return to England he became chaplain and
physician to the Duke of Somerset, and it is generally believed
that he sat in the House of Commons.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> He was promised the
prebend of Botevant in York, and in a letter written to thank
Cecil for the promise we find the remark, &ldquo;My chylder have
bene fed so long with hope that they are very leane, i wold
fayne have th&#275; fatter if it were possible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Turner held this appointment for little more than two years,
and after failing to obtain either the provostship of Oriel College,
Oxford, or the presidency of Magdalen, he seems to have become
despondent. He wanted a house &ldquo;where i may studie in and
have s&#363; place to lay my bookes in,&rdquo; and in another letter he
complains of &ldquo;being pened up in a chamber with all my ho[use]
holde seruantes and children as shepe in a pyndfolde.... i
can not go to my booke for ye crying of childer and noyse yt is
made in my chamber.&rdquo; Finally he begged leave to go abroad,
&ldquo;where I will also finishe my great herball and my bookes of
fishes, stones and metalles if God send me lyfe and helthe.&rdquo;
He was subsequently made Dean of Wells, but he lost this
office on the accession of Mary, and, like so many of the
Protestant divines, he went abroad. He stayed at Bonn,
Frankfort, Freiburg, Lauterburg [? Lauenburg], Mainz, Rodekirche,
Strasburg, Speyer, Worms, Cologne and Weissenburg.
At Cologne and Weissenburg he had gardens, and it was from
Cologne that he published the second part of his Herbal. His
works were proclaimed heretical for the second time in 1555,
and the Wardens of every Company had to give notice of any
copy they had in order that they might be destroyed. It is
not surprising that Turner&rsquo;s works are rare!</p>

<p>On the accession of Elizabeth he returned to England and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>79]</a></span>
was reinstated in the deanery of Wells.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> His diocesan seems to
have found him troublesome, for in 1559 the Bishop of Bath
and Wells wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;I am much encombred with mr. Doctor Turner Deane of
Welles for his indiscreete behavior in the pulpit where he medleth
w<sup>th</sup> all matters.... I have advertised him by wrytynges and
have admonished secretly by his owne frendes: notwithstanding
he persisteth still in his follie: he conten&#772;eth all Bishopps and
calleth th&#275; white coats, typpett gentlem&#275;, with other wordes of
reproche [mu]che more unsemlie and asketh &lsquo;who gave them
autoritie more ouer me then I ouer them&rsquo;?</p>

<p class="sig smcap">&ldquo;Gilbert Bath and Wells.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="address"><i>January 24,<br />
1559-60.</i></p>
</div>

<p>There is a story told that Turner trained his dog at a given
sign to snatch the bishop&rsquo;s square cap off his head when the
prelate was dining with him. If this is true, possibly it accounts
for the fact that he was subsequently suspended for Nonconformity,
after which, being precluded from clerical duties, he left
Wells and returned to London. He lived in Crutched Friars and,
like the two other Elizabethan herbalists, had a famous garden.
He was in failing health when he completed his herbal, and
there is extant a pathetic letter (the greater part of it written
by an amanuensis) to his staunch patron Lord Burleigh, which
is signed &ldquo;Your old and seikly client</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="sig">wllm turner doctor of physic.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Turner died in 1568, and was buried in S. Olave&rsquo;s, Crutched
Friars, where the tablet to his memory can still be seen.</p>

<p>In his will, which is too long to quote here, Turner bequeathed
to his wife<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> &ldquo;his best pece or syluer vessell and halfe dozen of
syluer spones,&rdquo; and to his nephew &ldquo;my lyttell furred gowne.&rdquo;
Peter, the son to whom he left &ldquo;all my writen bookes and if he
be a preacher all my diuinitie bookes, &amp; yf he practise Phisicke
all my physicke bookes,&rdquo; had some knowledge of plants, for in
a copy of Turner&rsquo;s Herbal in the Linnean Society&rsquo;s Library
there is a long list of errata for which Peter Turner apologised
in an Address to the Reader. There is something very na&iuml;ve
and charming about Peter&rsquo;s admiration for his father&rsquo;s &ldquo;fame
and estimation.&rdquo; He tells us that he has diligently compared
the printed book with his father&rsquo;s &ldquo;owne hande copie,&rdquo; and
refrains from having the whole book printed again because &ldquo;I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>81]</a></span>
should have done against Charitie to have caused the Printer
by that meanes to lose all his labor and cost which he hath
bestowed in printing hereof. Wherefore, gentle Reader, beare
a little with the Printer that never was much accustomed to
the printing of Englishe and afore thou reade over this booke
correct it as I haue appointed and then the profit thereof will
abundantly recompense thy paynes. In the meane time vse
this Herbale in stede of a better and give all laude and prayse
unto the Lorde.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Turner was the first Englishman who studied plants scientifically,
and his herbal marks the beginning of the science of
botany in England. Like most writers of any value, he
impressed his personality upon his books, and these show him
to have been a man of indomitable character, caustic wit and
independent thought. &ldquo;Vir solidae eruditionis judicii&rdquo; he is
called by John Ray. His first botanical work was the <i>Libellus
de re herbaria novus</i> (1538), printed by John Byddell in London.
This little book is particularly interesting, because it is the first
in which localities of native British plants are given. In 1548
he published another small book entitled <i>The names of herbes
in Greke, Latin, Englishe, Duche, and Frenche wyth the
commone names that Herbaries and Apotecaries use, gathered
by William Turner</i>. In the preface he tells us that he had
begun to &ldquo;set furth an herbal in latyn,&rdquo; but that when he
asked the advice of physicians, &ldquo;their advise was that I shoulde
cease from settynge out of this boke in latin till I had sene
those places of Englande, wherein is moste plentie of herbes,
that I might in my herbal declare to the greate honoure of our
countre what numbre of sovereine and strang herbes were in
England, that were not in other nations, whose counsell I have
folowed, deferrying to set out my herbal in latyn, tyl that I
have sene the west countrey, which I never sawe yet in al my
lyfe, which countrey of al places of England, as I heare say, is
moste richely replenished wyth al kindes of straunge and
wonderfull workes and giftes of nature as are stones, herbes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>82]</a></span>
fishes and metalles, when as they that moued me to the settyng
furth of my latin herbal, hearde this so reasonable an excuse,
they moved me to set out an herbal in Englishe as Fuchsius
dyd in latine wyth the discriptions, figures and properties of as
many herbes, as I had sene and knewe, to whom I could make
no other answere but that I had no such leasure in this vocation
and place that I am nowe in, as is neccessary for a man that
shoulde take in hande suche an interprise. But thys excuse
coulde not be admitted for both certeine scholars, poticaries,
and also surgeons, required of me if that I woulde not set furth
my latin herbal, before I have sene the west partes, and have
no leasure in thys place and vocation to write so great a worke,
at the least to set furth my judgement of the names of so many
herbes as I knew, whose request I have accomplished, and have
made a litle boke, which is no more but a table or regestre
of suche bokes as I intende by the grace of God to set furth
hereafter; if that I may obteine by your graces healp such
libertie and leasure with convenient place, as shall be necessary
for suche a purpose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Turner&rsquo;s notable work, his Herbal, is the only original work
on botany written by any Englishman in the sixteenth century.
The first part of it was printed in London by Steven Mierdman,
a Protestant refugee from Antwerp, in 1551. The second part
was printed by Arnold Birckman, at Cologne, in 1561, during
Turner&rsquo;s enforced exile. Birckman also printed the edition of
1568, which contained all three parts. (For the full title, etc.,
see <a href="#bibliographies">Bibliography of Herbals</a>, p. <a href="#Page_208">208</a>.)</p>

<p>One of the most attractive features of this Herbal is the
number of beautiful woodcuts with which it is illustrated. A
few were specially drawn and cut for the author, but the great
majority are reproductions of the exquisite drawings in Fuchs&rsquo;s
herbals (<i>De historia Stirpium</i>, 1545; and <i>Neue Kre&uuml;terbuch</i>,
1543). Nearly all the illustrations in the famous sixteenth-century
Flemish, English and Swiss herbals were printed from
the actual wood-blocks or copied from the illustrations in Fuchs&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>83]</a></span>
works. Notably in Hieronymus Bock&rsquo;s <i>Kre&uuml;ter Buch</i> (1546),
Rembert Dodoens&rsquo;s <i>Cru&yuml;dtboeck</i> (1554), Henry Lyte&rsquo;s <i>Niewe
Herball</i> (1578), and Jean Bauhin&rsquo;s <i>Historia plantarum universalis</i>
(1651). It is a remarkable fact that so far as wood-engraving
is concerned this country has contributed nothing to
the art of plant illustration. In the first English illustrated
Herbal, the <i>Grete Herball</i> of 1526, the figures are merely copies
of the inferior cuts in the later editions of the <i>Herbarius zu
Teutsch</i>, and, with the exception of Parkinson&rsquo;s <i>Paradisus</i>, all
the English sixteenth-&nbsp;and early seventeenth-century herbals
borrowed their illustrations from Flemish or German sources.
Fuchs had two sets of blocks for his Herbal, one for the folio
edition of 1542 and the other for the octavo edition of 1545.
It was the blocks for the latter which were borrowed by Turner&rsquo;s
printer, and it has been suggested that it was his desire to
secure these beautiful illustrations which led him to have his
herbal printed at Cologne.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> Over 400 of Fuchs&rsquo;s blocks were
used in the complete edition of Turner&rsquo;s Herbal, and, of the
rest, some are copied from the smaller figures in Mattioli&rsquo;s<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>
commentary on Dioscorides.</p>

<p>Turner dedicated the first part of his Herbal (1551) to the
Duke of Somerset, uncle to Edward VI., and at that time
Lord Protector. The preface is delightful and I quote a part
of it:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;To the mighty and christiane Prince Edward, Duke of
Summerset, Erle of Herford, Lorde Beauchampe, and Uncle unto
the Kynges maiesty, Wyllyam Turner his servant wysheth
increase in the knowledge of Goddes holy worde and grace to
lyue thereafter. Although (most myghty and Christian Prince)
there be many noble and excellent actes and sciences, which no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>84]</a></span>
man douteth but that almyghty God, the author of all goodness,
hath gyuen unto us by the hands of the Hethen, as necessary
unto the use of Mankynd: yet is there none among them all,
whych is so openly c&#333;mended by the verdit of any holy writer
in the Bible, as is ye knowledge of plantes, herbes, and trees
and of Phisick. I do not remembre that I have red anye
expressed commendations of Grammer, Logick, Philosophie,
naturall or morall, Astronomie, Arithmetyke, Geometry, Cosmographie,
Musycke, Perspectiue or any other such lyke science.
But I rede amonge the commendatyons and prayses of Kyng
Salomon, that he was sene in herbes shrubbes and trees and so
perfectly that he disputed wysely of them from the hyghest to
the lowest, that is from the Cedre tre in Mount Liban unto the
Hysop that groweth furth of the wall. If the Knowledge of
Herbes, shrubbes and trees which is not the lest necessary
thynge unto the knowledge of Phisicke were not greatly commendable
it shulde never have bene set among Salomon&rsquo;s commendacyons
and amongst the singular giftes of God. Therefor
whereas Salomon was commended for the Knowledge of Herbes
the same Knowledge was expressedly ynough com&#772;ended there
also.&rdquo; Continuing, he speaks of learned Englishmen &ldquo;Doctor
Clement, Doctor Wendy and Doctor Owen, Doctor Wolton and
Maister Falconer&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> which &ldquo;have as much knowledge in herbes
yea and more than diuerse Italianes and Germanes whyche have
set forth in prynte Herballes and bokes of simples. Yet hath
none of al these set furth any thyng other to the generall profit
of hole Christendome in latin and to the honor of thys realme,
nether in Englysh to the proper profit of their naturall countre.&rdquo;
After slyly observing that perhaps they do not care to jeopardise
their estimation, he compares himself, for having ventured to
write this book, with the soldier &ldquo;who is more frendly unto
the commonwealth, which adventurously runneth among the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>85]</a></span>
myddes of hys enemyes, both gyuyng and takyng blowes, then
he that, whilse other men feight, standeth in the top of a tre
iudging how other men do, he beynge without the danger of
gonne shot himself.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>To those who may object that it is too small, he explains
that he will write more fully when he has &ldquo;travelled diverse
shyres in England to learn more of the herbs that grow there.&rdquo;
Others may condemn him for writing in English, &ldquo;for now (say
they) every man without any study of necessary artes unto the
knowledge of Phisick will become a Phisician ... euery man
nay euery old wyfe will presume, not without the mordre of
many, to practyse Phisick.&rdquo; To these he succinctly replies,
&ldquo;How many surgianes and apothecaries are there in England
which can understand Plini in Latin or Galen and Dioscorides?&rdquo;
The English physicians, he says, rely on the apothecaries, and
they in turn on the old wives who gather the herbs. Moreover,
since the physicians are not present when their prescriptions
are made up, &ldquo;many a good m&#257; by ignorance is put in jeopardy
of his life, or good medecine is marred to the great dishonesty
both of the Phisician and of Goddes worthy creatures.&rdquo; All
this can be avoided by having a herbal written in English.
Dioscorides and Galen, he points out, wrote in their native
tongue, Greek. &ldquo;Dyd Dioscorides and Galen give occasion for
every old wyfe to take in h&#257;d the practise of Phisick? Did
they giue any iust occasion of murther? If they gaue no
occasyon unto every old wyfe to practise physike then give
I none. If they gave no occasion of murther then gyue I
none ... then am I no hynderer wryting unto the English
my countremen an English herball.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The second part of Turner&rsquo;s Herbal is dedicated to his old
patron, Thomas Lord Wentworth, and the complete work,
including the third part, to Queen Elizabeth.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> In the preface
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>86]</a></span>
to this last he reminds the queen of a conversation he had
had with her in Latin eighteen years before, at the Duke of
Somerset&rsquo;s house, when he was physician to that nobleman. It
is in this preface also that he criticises the foreign herbalists;
though he has learnt much from them, they had much to learn
from him, &ldquo;as their second editions maye testifye.&rdquo; He claims
that in the first part of his herbal he taught &ldquo;the truth of
certeyne plants which these above-named writers (Matthiolus,
Fuchsius, Tragus and Dodoneus) either knew not at al or ellis
erred in them greatlye.... And because I would not be lyke
unto a cryer yt cryeth a loste horse in the marketh, and telleth
all the markes and tokens that he hath, and yet never sawe the
horse, nether coulde knowe the horse if he sawe him: I wente
into Italye and into diverse partes of Germany, to knowe and
se the herbes my selfe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The book owes much of its charm to its vivid descriptions
of the plants, and the fascinating and unexpected details he
gives us about them. The comparison of dodder, for instance,
to &ldquo;a great red harpe strynge,&rdquo; is a happy touch which it is
impossible to forget. &ldquo;Doder groweth out of herbes and small
bushes as miscelto groweth out of trees. Doder is lyke a great
red harpe strynge and it wyndeth about herbes foldyng mych
about them and hath floures and knoppes one from an other a
good space.... The herbes that I have marked doder to
growe most in are flax and tares.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These accurate observations and careful descriptions are
characteristic of the writer, and recall similar touches in the
Saxon herbals. For example, he records that the stamens of
the Madonna lily have a different smell from the flower itself,
and that the berries of the bay tree are almost, but not quite,
round. There is only space to quote the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;The lily hath a long stalk and seldom more than one,
howbeit it hath somtyme II. It is II or III cubites hyghe. It
hath long leves and somthyng of the fashion of the great
satyrion. The flour is excedyng white and it hath the forme or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>87]</a></span>
fashion of a long quiver, that is to say, smal at the one end and
byg at the other. The leves of the floures are full of crestes,
and the overmost ends of the leves bowe a little backwarde
and from the lowest parte within come forth long small yelow
thynges lyke thredes of another smelle than the floures are of.
The roote is round and one pece groweth hard to another
allmoste after the maner of the roote of Garleke, but that the
clowes in the lily are broder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The leaves of the Bay tree are alwayes grene and in figure
and fashion they are lyke unto periwincle. They are long and
brodest in the middest of the lefe. They are blackishe grene
namely when they are olde. They are curled about the edges,
they smell well. And when they are casten into the fyre they
crake wonderfully. The tre in England is no great tre, but it
thryveth there many partes better and is lustier than in
Germany. The berries are allmoste round but not altogether.
The kirnell is covered with a thick black barke which may well
be parted from the kirnell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Blewbottel groweth in ye corne, it hath a stalke full of
corners, a narrow and long leefe. In the top of the stalke
is a knoppy head whereupon growe bleweflowers about midsummer.
The chylder use to make garlandes of the floure. It
groweth much amonge Rye wherefore I thinke that good ry
in an evell and unseasonable yere doth go out of kinde in to
this wede.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pennyroyal.&mdash;It crepeth much upon the ground and hath
many lytle round leves not unlyke unto the leves of merierum
gentil but that they are a little longer and sharper and also
litle indented rounde about, and grener than the leves of
meriurum ar. The leves grow in litle branches even from the
roote of certayn ioyntes by equall spaces one devyded from
an other. Where as the leves grow in litle tuftes upon the
over partes of the braunches.... Pennyroyal groweth much,
without any setting, besyd hundsley [Hounslow] upon the heth
beside a watery place.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>88]</a></span>
Of camomile he writes: &ldquo;It hath floures wonderfully
shynynge yellow and resemblynge the appell of an eye ... the
herbe may be called in English, golden floure. It will restore
a man to hys color shortly yf a man after the longe use of the
bathe drynke of it after he is come forthe oute of the bath.
This herbe is scarce in Germany but in England it is so plenteous
that it groweth not only in gardynes but also VIII mile above
London, it groweth in the wylde felde, in Rychmonde grene,
in Brantfurde grene.... Thys herb was consecrated by the
wyse men of Egypt unto the sonne and was rekened to be the
only remedy of all agues.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Unlike modern authorities, Turner contends that our English
hyssop is the same plant as that mentioned in the Bible, and
he also describes a species which does not now exist. &ldquo;We have
in Sumershire beside ye c&#333;m&#275; Hysop that groweth in all other
places of Englande a kinde of Hysop that is al roughe and hory
and it is greater muche and stronger then the c&#333;men Hysop is,
som call it rough Hysop.&rdquo; Another plant which seems to have
disappeared and which, he states, no other writer describes, is
&ldquo;the wonderful great cole with leaves thrise as thike as ever I
saw any other cole have. It hath whyte floures and round
berryes lyke yvy. This herbe groweth at douer harde by the
Sea-syde. I name it the Douer cole because I founde it first
besyde Douer.&rdquo; Incidentally he mentions samphire also as
growing at Dover.</p>

<p>It is interesting to find that Turner identifies the <i>Herba
Britannica</i> of Dioscorides and Pliny (famed for having cured
the soldiers of Julius C&aelig;sar of scurvy in the Rhine country) with
<i>Polygonum bistorta</i>, which he observed plentifully in Friesland,
the scene of Pliny&rsquo;s observations. This herb is held by more
modern authorities to be <i>Rumex aquations</i> (great water dock).</p>

<p class="captonly">ILLUSTRATIONS FROM TURNER&rsquo;S &ldquo;HERBAL&rdquo;</p>

<p>Throughout the Herbal there are recollections of the north
of England, where the author spent his boyhood. Of heath,
for instance, he tells us: &ldquo;The hyest hethe that ever I saw
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>89]</a></span>
groweth in Northumberland, which is so hyghe that a man may
hyde himself in.&rdquo; Of the wild hyacinth he writes: &ldquo;The
boyes in North&#363;berland scrape the roote of the herbe and glew
theyr arrowes and bokes wyth that slyme that they scrape of.&rdquo;
Of sea-wrake (seaweed) he tells us: &ldquo;In the Bishopriche of
Durham the housbandmen of the countie that dwel by the sea
syde use to fate [fatten, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> manure] their lande with seawrake.&rdquo;
Under &ldquo;birch&rdquo; we find: &ldquo;Fisherers in Northumberland pyll
off the uttermost barke and put it in the clyft of a sticke and set
in fyre and hold it at the water syde and make fish come thether,
whiche if they se they stryke with theyr leysters or sammon
speres. The same,&rdquo; he continues, &ldquo;is good to make hoopes of
and twigges for baskettes, it is so bowinge. It serveth for many
good uses and for none better then for betinge of stubborne
boyes that ether lye or will not learne.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cudweed &ldquo;is called in Northumberland chafwede because
it is thought to be good for chafyng of any man&rsquo;s fleshe wyth
goynge or rydynge.&rdquo; And it would be interesting to know if the
daisy is still called banwurt in the north. &ldquo;The Northern men
call thys herbe banwurt because it helpeth bones to knyt
agayne.... Plinie writeth that the dasey hath III and sometimes
IV little whyte leves whiche go about the yelow knope,
it appereth that the double Daseys were not founde in plinies
tyme whych have a greate dele mo then Plini maketh mention
of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There are other country customs which he records.
&ldquo;Shepherds use clivers [goosegrass] in stede of a strayner to
pull out here of the mylke;&rdquo; &ldquo;birderers [bird-catchers] take
bowes of birch and lime the twigges and go a bat folinge with
them;&rdquo; &ldquo;som make a lee [lye] or an ashy water of the rotes
of gentian wherwyth they toke out spottes very well out of
cloth.&rdquo; He mentions woad as &ldquo;trimmed wyth mannes labor
in dyenge and wull and clothe,&rdquo; and teazle &ldquo;which the fullers
dresse their cloth wtall.&rdquo; Apparently Turner gave the spindle
tree its name, for he says: &ldquo;I coulde never learne an Englishe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>90]</a></span>
name for it. The Duche men call it in Netherlande, spilboome,
that is, spindel tree, because they use to make spindels of it in
that countrey, and me thynke it maye be so well named in
English seying we have no other name.... I know no good
propertie that this tree hath, saving only it is good to make
spindels and brid of cages&rdquo; [bird cages].</p>

<p>The use of complexion washes was a custom on which Turner
was alarmingly severe. There are fewer beauty recipes in
his herbal than in any other&mdash;only four altogether. &ldquo;Some
weomen,&rdquo; we find, &ldquo;sprinkle ye floures of cowslip w<sup>t</sup> whyte
wine and after still it and wash their faces w<sup>t</sup> that water to
drive wrinkles away and to make them fayre in the eyes of the
worlde rather then in the eyes of God, whom they are not afrayd
to offend.&rdquo; And of marygold we learn that &ldquo;Summe use to
make theyr here yelow with the floure of this herbe, not beyng
cont&#275;t with the naturall colour which God hath geven th&#275;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There is curiously little folk lore in this herbal, and most of it
is guarded by &ldquo;some do say&rdquo; or &ldquo;some hold.&rdquo; Nevertheless,
with this qualification, Turner gives us fragments of folk lore
not to be found in other herbals. For instance, that nutshells
burnt and bound to the back of a child&rsquo;s head will make grey
eyes black, and that parsley thrown into fish ponds will heal
the sick fishes therein. Again, this is the first herbal in which
any account is to be found of the very old custom of curing
disease in cattle by boring a hole in the ear and inserting the
herb bearfoot.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;They say it should be used thus. The brodest part of the
ear must have a round circle made about it w<sup>t</sup> the blood that
rinneth furth with a brasen botken and the same circle must
be round lyke unto the letter O, and when this is done without
and in the higher part of the ear the halfe of the foresaid
circle is to be bored thorowe with the foresaid botken and the
roote of the herbe is to be put in at the hole, when y<sup>t</sup> newe
wounde that hath receyued it holdeth it so fast, that it will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>91]</a></span>
not let it go furth, then all the mighte and pestilent poison of
the disease is brought so into the eare. And whilse the part
which is circled aboute dyeth and falleth awaye y<sup>t</sup> hole beast
is saved with the lose of a very small parte.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another piece of folk lore is remarkable because it is the only
instance in an English herbal of a belief in the effect of a human
being on a plant: &ldquo;If ye woulde fayne have very large and
greate gourdes, then take sedes that growe there [in the sides]....
And let weomen nether touche the yonge gourdes nor loke
upon them, for the only touchinge and sighte of weomen kille
the yonge gourdes.&rdquo; This belief he quotes from Pliny.</p>

<p>Turner, again, is the only old herbalist who refers to the old
and widespread belief that larch was fire-proof. It was largely
used, he tells us, for laying under the tiles of newly-built houses,
as &ldquo;a sure defence against burning,&rdquo; and he narrates at length
how Julius C&aelig;sar was unable to burn a tower built with larch.
On the old mandrake legend he is scathing. &ldquo;The rootes
which are counterfited and made like litle puppettes and
mammettes which come to be sold in England in boxes with heir
[hair] and such forme as man hath, are nothyng elles but folishe
fened trifles and not naturall. For they are so trymmed of
crafty theves to mocke the poore people withall and to rob them
both of theyr wit and theyr money. I have in my tyme at
diverse tymes tak&#275; up the rootes of mandrake out of the grounde
but I never saw any such thyng upon or in them as are in and
upon the pedlers rootes that are comenly to be solde in boxes.
It groweth not under galloses [gallows] as a certayn doting doctor
of Colon in his physick lecture dyd teach hys auditors.&rdquo; But
he accepts without question the belief in its efficacy as an
an&aelig;sthetic: &ldquo;It is given to those who must be burned or cut
in some place that they should not fele the burning or cuttyng.&rdquo;
Of wine made of it, he says: &ldquo;If they drynk thys drynke they
shall fele no payne, but they shall fall into a forgetfull and
slepishe drowsiness. Of the apples of mandrake, if a man smell
of them thei will make hym slepe and also if they be eaten.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>92]</a></span>
But they that smell to muche of the apples become dum ... thys
herbe diverse wayes taken is very jepardus for a man and
may kill hym if he eat it or drynk it out of measure and have
no remedy from it.... If mandragora be taken out of measure
by and by slepe ensueth and a great lousing of the streyngthe
with a forgetfulness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Turner is one of the few herbalists who cautions against
the excessive use of any herb. &ldquo;Onions eaten in meat largely
make the head ake, they make them forgetfull whiche in the
tyme of syknes use them out of mesure.&rdquo; &ldquo;Cole engendreth
euell and melancholie juice. It dulleth the syght and it
troubleth the slepe wyth contrary thynges which are sene in
the dreme.&rdquo; Of nigella he writes: &ldquo;Take hede that ye take
not to muche of this herbe, for if ye go beyonde the mesure it
bryngeth deth.&rdquo; &ldquo;Hemp seed,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;if it be taken out of
measure taketh men&rsquo;s wyttes from th&#275; as coriander doth.&rdquo; &ldquo;If
any person use saffron measurably it maketh in them a good
colour, but if thei use it out of mesure it maketh hym loke
pale, and maketh the hede ache and hurteth the appetite.&rdquo; For
those who have taken an overdose of opium there is a surprising
remedy. &ldquo;If the pacient be to much slepi put stynkynge
thynges unto hys nose to waken hym therewith.&rdquo; As in all
herbals of this period, there are an astonishing number of
remedies against melancholy and suggestions for those whose
weak brains will not stand much strong drink; but, while
remedies for broken heads, so common in the older herbals, are
conspicuously absent, we find that walnuts are recommended
&ldquo;for the bytings both of men and dogges&rdquo;!</p>

<p>As in the <i>Grete Herball</i>, there are many descriptions of other
substances besides herbs, some of the longest being of dates,
rice, olives, citron, pomegranates and lentils. The account of
citron it would be pleasant to transcribe in full, not for the sake
of the story but for the manner of the telling. One could listen
to a sermon of considerable length from a divine who, in a book
intended for grown-ups, has a tale of &ldquo;two naughty murthering
robbers, condemned for theyr murder and robery to be flayn and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>93]</a></span>
poysoned to deth of serpentes, and such venemous bestes,&rdquo; and
of the one who, owing to having eaten &ldquo;a pece of citron,&rdquo;
remained, Daniel-like, unhurt by the poison of the snakes, whilst
the other who had not taken this precaution &ldquo;fell down sterk
dede.&rdquo; And finally, the moral&mdash;&ldquo;Wherefore it were wisdome
that noblemen and other that are bydden to dynner of theyr
enemies or suspected frendes before they eat any other thyng
should take a pece of citron.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The later sixteenth-century herbalists owed much to the
famous herbalists of the Netherlands, and above all to that
prince amongst publishers, Christophe Plantin of Antwerp,
whose personality secured him a unique place in the literary
world. Indeed, there is a splendour about the works of the
Flemish herbalists unequalled by any others of this period,
with the exception of the Bavarian doctor Leonhard Fuchs.
There is no comparison between them and the Italian herbalists
of the Renaissance, who, for the greater part, devoted themselves
to studying the classical writers and identifying the plants
mentioned by the old authorities. France, curiously enough,
contributed comparatively little when the herbal was at its
zenith, though it must of course be remembered that the
Bauhins, who rank as Swiss herbalists, were of French extraction.
But it is difficult to estimate the influence of the works
of those three notable friends, Rembert Dodoens, Charles de
l&rsquo;Escluse and Matthias de l&rsquo;Obel, particularly on the English
herbalists. The most famous English herbal&mdash;Gerard&rsquo;s&mdash;is
virtually a translation of the <i>Pemptades</i> of Dodoens. Lyte&rsquo;s translation
of the <i>Cru&yuml;dtboeck</i> was the standard work on herbs during
the latter part of the century, and Parkinson incorporated a large
part of de l&rsquo;Obel&rsquo;s unfinished book in his <i>Theatrum Botanicum</i>.</p>

<p>De l&rsquo;Obel, after whom the little garden flower&mdash;lobelia&mdash;is
named, spent the greater part of his life in England. He was
a Fleming by birth and a doctor by profession,<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> and he was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>94]</a></span>
physician to William the Silent until his assassination. About
1569 he came over to England (with his friend Pena, who at one
time was physician to Louis XIII.) and lived at Highgate with
his son-in-law. He superintended Lord Zouche&rsquo;s garden at
Hackney, and later was given the title of botanist to James I.
L&rsquo;Obel&rsquo;s great work, written in collaboration with Pena, was
the <i>Stirpium Adversaria Nova</i>, printed in London by Thomas
Purfoot in 1571.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> Pulteney, in his <i>Biographical Sketches</i> (1790),
makes the extraordinary statement that Christophe Plantin of
Antwerp was the real printer. It has, however, been pointed
out by modern authorities that the archives of the Plantin
Museum show that Plantin bought 800 copies of Purfoot&rsquo;s
edition, with the wood blocks, for 1320 florins. In 1576 Plantin
published de l&rsquo;Obel&rsquo;s <i>Plantarum seu Stirpium historia</i>, and to
this he appended the first part of the <i>Adversaria</i>, keeping
Purfoot&rsquo;s original colophon.</p>

<p>Although Dodoens neither lived in England nor had any of
his works printed here, his <i>Cru&yuml;dtboeck</i> became one of the
standard works in this country through Lyte&rsquo;s translation.
Dodoens was born at Malines about 1517 and, after studying at
Louvain, visited the universities and medical schools of France,
Italy and Germany, graduated M.D., and was appointed
physician to Maximilian II. and Rudolf II. successively. In
the latter part of his life he was Professor of Medicine at Leyden,
where he died in 1585. Plantin published Dodoens&rsquo;s most
important work, <i>Stirpium histori&aelig; pemptades sex sive libri
triginta</i>, in which some of the figures are copied from the fifth-century
manuscript<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> copy of Dioscorides. Dodoens&rsquo;s first book,
the <i>Cru&yuml;dtboeck</i>, was translated into French by his friend Charles
de l&rsquo;Escluse<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> and afterwards into English by Henry Lyte.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>95]</a></span>
Lyte, who was an Oxford man, travelled extensively in his
youth and made a collection of rare plants. He contributed
nothing original to the literature on herbs, but his translation
of the French version of the <i>Cru&yuml;dtboeck</i> was an inestimable
service. His own copy of the French version, which is now
in the British Museum, has on the title-page the quaint inscription
&ldquo;Henry Lyte taught me to speake Englishe.&rdquo; The book
is full of MS. notes and references to Turner.</p>

<p>The full title of Lyte&rsquo;s book is as follows: &ldquo;A niewe Herball
or Historie of Plantes: wherein is contayned the whole discourse
and perfect description of all sortes of Herbes and Plantes:
their divers and sundry kindes: their straunge Figures, Fashions
and Shapes: their Names, Natures, Operations, and Vertues:
and that not only of those which are here growyng in this our
Countrie of Englande but of all others also of forrayne Realmes,
commonly used in Physicke. First set foorth in the Doutche or
Almaigne tongue by that learned D. Rembert Dodoens, Physition
to the Emperour: And nowe first translated out of French
into English by Henry Lyte Esquyer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>(<i>Colophon.</i>) &ldquo;Imprinted at Antwerpe by Me Henry Lo&euml;
Booke printer and are to be solde at London in Paul&rsquo;s churchyarde
by Gerard Dewes.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>The beautiful illustrations in Lyte&rsquo;s <i>Dodoens</i> are to a large
extent printed from the same blocks as those in the octavo
edition (1545) of Fuchs. In Fuchs there are about 516 illustrations,
and in Lyte&rsquo;s <i>Dodoens</i> about 870. Those which are
not copied from Fuchs were probably collected by Dodoens
himself, who, according to some verses at the beginning of the
herbal, took a practical interest in the publication of the English
translation of his book.</p>

<p>The original wood-blocks never came to England, and three
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>96]</a></span>
years later van der Lo&euml;&rsquo;s widow sold them to Christophe Plantin
for 420 florins.</p>

<p>All the commendatory verses at the beginning of Lyte&rsquo;s
herbal are in Latin, except some lines in which William Clowes
speaks of writing about herbs as &ldquo;a fit occupation for gentlemen
and wights of worthy fame,&rdquo; and recalls the great men
who have immortalised themselves thereby, notably Gentius,
Lysimachus, Mythridates and Dioscorides. Then, after giving
due praise to Dodoens, &ldquo;Whose learned skill hath offered first
this worthy worke to vewe,&rdquo; Clowes ends with four lines in
which he plays upon the name of the translator:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;And Lyte, whose toyle hath not bene light to dye it in this grayne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deserves no light regarde of us: but thankes and thankes agayne.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sure I am all English hartes that lyke of Physickes lore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will also lyke this gentleman: and thanke hym muche therefore.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>The herbal is dedicated to Queen Elizabeth &ldquo;as the best token
of love and diligence that I am at this time able to shew....
And doubtless if my skill in the translation were answerable to
the worthynesse eyther of the Historie itselfe or of the Authours
thereof I doubt not but I should be thought to haue honoured
your Maiestie with an acceptable present.&rdquo; The preface is
dated from &ldquo;my poore house at Lytes carie within your Maiesties
Countie of Somerset the first day of Januarie MDLXXVIII.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In 1606 there appeared the book commonly known as <i>Ram&rsquo;s
little Dodoen</i>. It purported to be an epitome of Lyte&rsquo;s <i>Dodoens</i>,
but, though some of its matter has been abridged from Dodoens&rsquo;s
work, it is in reality a compilation of recipes unworthy of the
great name it bears. In his preface the author tells us: &ldquo;I
have bestowed some tyme in reducing the most exquisit new
herball or history of plants (first set forth in Dutch and Almayne
tongue by the learned and worthy man of famous memory
Dr. Rembert Dodeon (<i>sic</i>) Phisician to the Emperor, and translated
into English by Master Henry Lyte Esq.), with a brief
and short epitome ... so as where the great booke at large is
not to be had but at a great price, which cannot be procured
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>97]</a></span>
by the poorer sort, my endevor herein hath bin chiefly to make
the benefit of so good, necessary and profitable a worke to be
brought within the reach and compasse as well of you my poore
countrymen and women whose lives, healths, ease and welfare
is to be regarded with the rest, at a smaller price than the great
volume is. My onely and greatest care hath byn of long tyme
to knowe or thinke how and upon whome to bestow the dedication
of this my small labour. And in the penning of this my
letter my Affections are satisfied with the dedication thereof to
these my poore and loving countrymen whosoever and to
whose hands soever it may come. For whose sake I have
desired publicati&#333; of the same, beseeching Almighty God to
blesse us all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The book is curiously arranged, for on one page we have
&ldquo;the practice of Dodoen,&rdquo; and on the opposite &ldquo;the practises
of others for the same Phisike helpes, collected and presented
to the Author of this Treatise.&rdquo; There are directions for each
month, and each is headed by a motto. The twelve mottoes,
when read together, form the following quaint rhyme:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

</div>
</div>

<p>There are some things in this little handbook worthy of remembrance,
notably an imaginative passage in which the author
tells us that &ldquo;herbs that grow in the fields are better than
those which grow in gardens, and of those herbs which grow in
the fieldes, such as grow on hilles are best.&rdquo;</p>

It has been suggested that Turner was imprisoned for his refusal to
subscribe to the Six Articles and that he recanted to save his life. But, as
Dr. B.&nbsp;D. Jackson has pointed out, Turner was made of sterner stuff and his
whole life and writings are a standing contradiction to any such supposition.</p>

One of the earliest botanic gardens in Europe was at Bologna. It was
founded by Luca Ghini. It is interesting to see how frequently Turner in
his herbal quotes Ghini, and cites his authority against other commentators.
Luca Ghini was the first who erected a separate professorial chair at Bologna
for Botanical Science. He himself lectured on Dioscorides for twenty-eight
years. He was the preceptor of Caesalpinus and Anquillara, two of the
soundest critics on botanical writings of that age.</p>

seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries were the following. I give them

The Duke of Somerset was himself keenly interested in botanical investigations,
and Turner frequently refers to the Duke&rsquo;s garden. It was during
this time that Turner had his own garden at Kew. That he sat in the House
of Commons is generally supposed from a passage in his <i>Spiritual Physik</i>,
and this view is sustained by the character of the Hunter in his <i>Romish Wolfe</i>.</p>

<h2><a name="chap04" id="chap04"></a>CHAPTER IV<br />
<br />
<span class="smlfont">GERARD&rsquo;S HERBAL</span></h2>

<div class="chaptop">
<p>&ldquo;If odours may worke satisfaction, they are so soveraigne in plants and
so comfortable that no confection of the apothecaries can equall their excellent
vertue.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Gerard&rsquo;s Herbal</i>, 1597.</p>
</div>


<p>When one looks at the dingy, if picturesque, thoroughfare
of Fetter Lane it is difficult to realise that it was once the site
of Gerard&rsquo;s garden, and it is pleasant to remember that the city
of London in those far-off days was as noted for the beauty of
its gardens as for its stately houses. The owner of this particular
garden in Fetter Lane is the most famous of all the English
herbalists. His Herbal,<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> which was published in 1597, gripped
the imagination of the English garden-loving world, and now,
after the lapse of three hundred years, it still retains its hold on
us. There are English-speaking people the world over who may
know nothing of any other, but at least by name they know
Gerard&rsquo;s Herbal. In spite of the condemnation he has justly
earned, not only in modern times, but from the critics of his
own day, for having used Dr. Priest&rsquo;s translation of Dodoens&rsquo;s
<i>Pemptades</i> without acknowledgment, no one can wander in the
mazes of Gerard&rsquo;s monumental book without succumbing to
its fascination. One reads his critics with the respect due to
their superior learning, and then returns to Gerard&rsquo;s Herbal with
the comfortable sensation of slipping away from a boring sermon
into the pleasant spaciousness of an old-fashioned fairy-tale.
For the majority of us are not scientific, nor do we care very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>99]</a></span>
much about being instructed. What we like is to read about
daffodils and violets and gilliflowers and rosemary and thyme
and all the other delicious old-fashioned English flowers. And
when we can read about them in the matchless Elizabethan
English we ask nothing more. Who that has read it once can
forget those words in the preface?&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;What greater delight is there than to behold the earth
apparelled with plants as with a robe of embroidered works,
set with Orient pearls and garnished with great diversitie of rare
and costly jewels? But these delights are in the outward
senses. The principal delight is in the minde, singularly enriched
with the knowledge of these visible things, setting forth to us
the invisible wisdome and admirable workmanship of almighty
God.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>And could any modern writer give with such simplicity and
charm the &ldquo;atmosphere&rdquo; of the violet?</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;Addressing myself unto the violets called the blacke
or purple violets or March violete of the Garden, which have a
great prerogative above others, not only because the minde
conceiveth a certaine pleasure and recreation by smelling and
handling of these most odoriferous flowers, but also that very
many by these violets receive ornament and comely Grace:
for there be made of them garlands for the head, nosegaies and
posies, which are delightful to look on and pleasant to smell,
speaking nothing of the appropriate vertues; yea Gardens
themselves receive by these the greatest ornament of all, chiefest
beautie and most gallant grace; and the recreation of the Minde
which is taken heereby, cannot bee but verie good and honest;
for flowers through their beautie, varietie of colour and exquisite
formes do bring to a liberall and gentlemanly minde the remembrance
of honestie, comeliness and all kindes of vertues. For it
would be an unseemly thing, as a certain wise man saith, for
him that doth looke upon and handle faire and beautifull things,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>100]</a></span>
and who frequenteth and is conversant in faire and beautifull
places to have his minde not faire.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>The bones, so to speak, of Gerard&rsquo;s work are, it is true, taken
from Dodoens&rsquo;s splendid Latin herbal, but it is Gerard&rsquo;s own
additions which have given the book its hold on our affections.
He describes with such simplicity and charm the localities where
various plants are to be found, and he gives so much contemporary
folk lore that before we have been reading long we feel
as though we were wandering about in Elizabethan England
with a wholly delightful companion.</p>

<p>We know from Gerard&rsquo;s coat of arms that he was descended
from a younger branch of the Gerards of Ince, a Lancashire
family, but there are no records at the College of Arms to show
his parentage. His name is frequently spelt with an e at the
end, but Gerard himself and his friends invariably spelt it without.
(The spelling &ldquo;Gerarde&rdquo; on the title-page of the Herbal
is probably an engraver&rsquo;s error.) John Gerard was born at
Nantwich in Cheshire in 1545, and educated at the school at
Wisterson or Willaston, two miles from his native town. In
the Herbal he gives us two glimpses of his boyhood. Under
raspberry we find:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;Raspis groweth not wilde that I know of.... I found it
among the bushes of a causey neere unto a village called Wisterson,
where I went to schoole, two miles from the Nantwich in
Cheshire.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Writing of yew<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> he tells us:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;They say that if any doe sleepe under the shadow thereof
it causeth sickness and sometimes death and that if birds do eat
of the fruit thereof it causeth them to cast their feathers and
many times to die. All which I dare boldly affirme is altogether
untrue: for when I was young and went to schoole divers of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>101]</a></span>
my schoole-fellowes and likewise myselfe did eat our fils of the
berries of this tree and have not only slept under the shadow
thereof but among the branches also, without any hurt at all,
and that not one time but many times.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>It is supposed that at an early age he studied medicine.
In his Herbal he speaks of having travelled to Moscow, Denmark,
Sweden and Poland, and it is possible that he went abroad as
a ship&rsquo;s surgeon. This, however, is mere surmise. We know
that in 1562 he was apprenticed to Alexander Mason, who
evidently had a large practice, for he was twice warden of the
Barber-Surgeons&rsquo; Company. Gerard was admitted to the freedom
of the same company in 1569.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> Before 1577 he must have
settled in London, for in his Herbal he tells us that for twenty
years he had superintended the gardens belonging to Lord Burleigh
in the Strand and at Theobalds in Hertfordshire. Hentzner,
in his <i>Itinerarium</i>, gives a lengthy account of the gardens at
Theobalds when Gerard was superintendent.</p>

<p>Gerard&rsquo;s own house was in Holborn and, as already mentioned,
his garden, where he had over a thousand different herbs, was
in what is now Fetter Lane.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> What a wonderful garden that
must have been, and how full it was of &ldquo;rarities,&rdquo; ranging from
white thyme to the double-flowered peach. How often we read
of various plants, &ldquo;these be strangers in England yet I have
them in my garden,&rdquo; sometimes with the triumphant addition,
&ldquo;where they flourish as in their natural place of growing.&rdquo; In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>102]</a></span>
1596 Gerard published a catalogue of twenty-four pages of the
plants in this garden&mdash;the first complete catalogue of the plants
in any garden, public or private.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> A second edition was
published in 1599. Of Gerard&rsquo;s knowledge of plants the members
of his own profession had a high opinion. George Baker, one
of the &ldquo;chief chirurgions in ordinarie&rdquo; to Queen Elizabeth,
wrote of him: &ldquo;I protest upon my conscience that I do not
thinke for the Knowledge of plants that he is inferior to any,
for I did once see him tried with one of the best strangers that
ever came into England and was accounted in Paris the onely
man,<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> being recommended to me by that famous man M. Amb.
Parens; and he being here was desirous to go abroad with some
of our herbarists, for the whiche I was the means to bring them
together, and one whole day we spent therein, searching the
most rarest simples: but when it came to the triall my French
man did not know one to his fower.&rdquo; In 1598, the year after
the publication of his Herbal, and again in 1607, Gerard was
appointed examiner of candidates for admission to the freedom
of the Barber-Surgeons&rsquo; Company, but apart from this we have
little definite knowledge of his life. He seems to have been a
well-known figure in the later years of Elizabeth and the early
years of James I., and it is probable that he held the same
position in the household of Robert Earl of Salisbury, Secretary
of State, as he had held in that of his father, Lord Burleigh. A
few years before he died James&rsquo;s queen (Anne of Denmark)
granted him the lease of a garden (two acres in all) east of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>103]</a></span>
Somerset House for four pence a year. Besides the rent he had
to give &ldquo;at the due and proper seasons of the yeare a convenient
proportion and quantitie of herbes, floures, or fruite, renewing
or growing within the said garden plott or piece of grounde, by
the arte and industrie of the said John Gerard, if they be lawfully
required and demanded.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> Gerard only kept this garden for
a year. In 1605 he parted with his interest in it to Robert
Earl of Salisbury, and it is interesting to note that in the legal
documents connected with this transaction he is described as
herbarist to James I. Of his private life we know nothing beyond
that he was married and that his wife helped him in his work.
He died in February 1611-1612, and was buried in St. Andrew&rsquo;s
Church, Holborn.</p>

<p>In 1597, as we have seen, Gerard published the Herbal which
made him famous, but its history, as his critics point out, reflects
little credit on the author. John Norton, the Queen&rsquo;s printer,
had commissioned Dr. Priest, a member of the College of
Physicians, to translate Dodoens&rsquo;s <i>Pemptades</i> from Latin into
English. Priest died before he finished his work and the
unfinished translation came somehow into Gerard&rsquo;s hands.
Gerard altered the arrangement of the herbs from that of
Dodoens to that of de l&rsquo;Obel in his <i>Adversaria</i>, and of Priest&rsquo;s
translation he merely says: &ldquo;Dr. Priest, one of our London
College, hath (as I heard) translated the last edition of Dodoens,
which meant to publish the same, but being prevented by death
his translation likewise perished.&rdquo; There are no fewer than
1800 illustrations in the Herbal, most of them taken from the
same wood-blocks that Tabern&aelig;montanus (Bergzabern) used
for his <i>Eicones</i> (1590). Norton, the Queen&rsquo;s printer, procured
the loan of these wood-blocks from Nicolas Bass&aelig;us of Frankfurt.
They are good specimens, and certainly superior to the sixteen
original cuts which Gerard added. It is interesting, however,
to note that amongst the latter is the first published representation
of the &ldquo;Virginian&rdquo; potato. Gerard made so many mistakes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>104]</a></span>
in connection with the illustrations that James Garret, a London
apothecary (and the correspondent of Charles de l&rsquo;Escluse), called
Norton&rsquo;s attention to the matter. Norton thereupon asked
de l&rsquo;Obel to correct the work, and, according to de l&rsquo;Obel&rsquo;s own
account, he was obliged to make over a thousand alterations.
Gerard then stopped any further emendation, on the ground
that the work was sufficiently accurate, and declared further
that de l&rsquo;Obel had forgotten the English language. Mr. B.&nbsp;D.
Jackson affirms that when one compares the Herbal with the
catalogue of the plants in his garden Gerard seems to have been
in the right. On the other hand, de l&rsquo;Obel in his <i>Illustrationes</i>
speaks of Gerard with great bitterness and alleges that the latter
pilfered from the <i>Adversaria</i> without acknowledgment.</p>

<p>When one turns to the Herbal one forgets the bitterness
of these old quarrels and Gerard&rsquo;s possible duplicity in the never-failing
charm of the book itself. It is not merely a translation
of Dodoens&rsquo;s <i>Pemptades</i>, for throughout the volume are inserted
Gerard&rsquo;s own observations, numerous allusions to persons and
places of antiquarian interest, and a good deal of contemporary
folk-lore. No fewer than fifty of Gerard&rsquo;s own friends are
mentioned, and one realises as one wanders through the pages
of this vast book that he received plants from all the then
accessible parts of the globe. Lord Zouche sent him rare seeds
from Crete, Spain and Italy. Nicholas Lete, a London merchant,
was a generous contributor to Gerard&rsquo;s garden and his name
appears frequently. Gerard writes of him: &ldquo;He is greatly in
love with rare and faire flowers, for which he doth carefully
send unto Syria, having a servant there at Aleppo, and in many
other countries.&rdquo; It was Nicholas Lete who sent Gerard an
&ldquo;orange tawnie gilliflower&rdquo; from Poland. William Marshall,
a chirurgeon on board the <i>Hercules</i>, sent him rarities from the
Mediterranean. The names which appear most frequently in
connection with indigenous plants are those of Thomas Hesketh,
a Lancashire gentleman, Stephen Bridwell, &ldquo;a learned and
diligent searcher of simples in the West of England,&rdquo; James
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>105]</a></span>
Cole, a London merchant, &ldquo;a lover of plants and very skilful
in the knowledge of them,&rdquo; and James Garret, a London apothecary
and a tulip enthusiast, who &ldquo;every season bringeth forth
new plants of sundry colours not before seen, all of which to
describe particularly were to roll Sisiphus&rsquo;s stone or number the
sands.&rdquo; Jean Robin, the keeper of the royal gardens in Paris,
sent him many rarities. For instance, of barrenwort (<i>Epimedium
alpinum</i>) he writes: &ldquo;This was sent to me from the French
King&rsquo;s herbarist Robinus dwellying in Paris at the syne of the
blacke heade in the street called Du bout du Monde, in English
the end of the world.&rdquo; In view of Sir Walter Raleigh&rsquo;s well-known
enthusiasm for collecting rare plants, it is at least possible
that he may have been a donor to Gerard&rsquo;s garden.</p>

<p class="captonly">PORTRAIT OF JOHN GERARD FROM THE FIRST EDITION OF THE &ldquo;HERBALL&rdquo; (1597)</p>

<p>Even the most cursory reading of the book suggests how much
we lose by the lack of the old simple belief in the efficacy of
herbs to cure not only physical ills, but also those of the mind and
even of the heart. This belief was shared by the greatest
civilisations of antiquity, and it is only we poor moderns who
ignore the fact that &ldquo;very wonderful effects may be wrought by
the Vertues, which are enveloped within the compasse of the
Green Mantles wherewith many Plants are adorned.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> Doctors
are cautious folk nowadays, but it is wonderful to think of a
time when the world was so young that people were brave and
hopeful enough to imagine that mere humans could alleviate,
even cure, the sorrows of others. If ever anything so closely
approaching the miraculous is attempted again one feels very
sure that we shall turn, as the wise men of the oldest civilisations
did, to God&rsquo;s most beautiful creations to accomplish the
miracle. In common with the majority of the old herbalists,
Gerard had a faith in herbs which was simple and unquestioning.
Sweet marjoram, he tells us, is for those &ldquo;who are given to
over-much sighing.&rdquo; Again, &ldquo;The smell of Basil is good for the
heart ... it taketh away sorrowfulness, which commeth of
melancholy and maketh a man merry and glad.&rdquo; &ldquo;Bawme
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>106]</a></span>
comforts the heart and driveth away all melancholy and sadnesse:
it makes the heart merry and joyfull and strengtheneth the
vitall spirits.&rdquo; &ldquo;Chervil root boiled and after dressed as the
cunning Cook knoweth how better than myself is very good for
old people that are dull and without courage.&rdquo; Of the despised
dead-nettle he tells us that &ldquo;the flowers baked with sugar, as
roses are, maketh the vitall spirits more fresh and lively.&rdquo; In
connection with borage he quotes the well-known old couplet:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;I Borage<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bring alwaies Courage.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Those of our time,&rdquo; he continues, &ldquo;do use the floures in
sallads to exhilerate the mind and make the mind glad. There
be also many things made of them, used everywhere for the
comfort of the heart, for the driving away of sorrow and encreasing
the joy of the minde.... The leaves and floures put into
wine make men and women glad and merry and drive away all
sadnesse, dulnesse and melancholy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of bugloss he says: &ldquo;The physitions use the leaves, floures
and rootes and put them into all kindes of medecines indifferently,
which are of force and vertue to drive away sorrow and pensiveness
of the minde, and to comfort and strengthen the heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rosemary was held of such sovereign virtue in this respect
that even the wearing of it was believed to be remedial. &ldquo;If a
garland thereof be put about the head, it comforteth the brain,
the memorie, the inward senses and comforteth the heart and
maketh it merry.&rdquo; Certain herbs strewed about the room were
supposed to promote happiness and content. Meadowsweet,
water-mint and vervain (one of the three herbs held most
sacred by the Druids) were those most frequently used for this
purpose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The savor or smell of the water-mint rejoyceth the heart
of man, for which cause they use to strew it in chambers and
places of recreation, pleasure and repose, where feasts and
banquets are made.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The leaves and floures of meadowsweet farre excelle all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>107]</a></span>
other strowing herbs for to decke up houses, to strawe in chambers,
halls and banqueting houses in the summertime, for the smell
thereof makes the heart merrie and joyful and delighteth the
senses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In connection with vervain he quotes Pliny&rsquo;s saying that &ldquo;if
the dining room be sprinckled with water in which the herbe hath
been steeped the guests will be the merrier.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Scattered through the Herbal we find recipes for the cure of
many other ailments with which modern science does not
attempt to cope. For instance, under &ldquo;peony&rdquo; we read:
&ldquo;The black graines (that is the seed) to the number of fifteene
taken in wine or mead is a speciall remedie for those that are
troubled in the night with the disease called the Night Mare,
which is as though a heavy burthen were laid upon them and they
oppressed therewith, as if they were overcome with their enemies,
or overprest with some great weight or burthen, and they are
also good against melancholie dreames.&rdquo; Under Solomon&rsquo;s seal
one lights on this: &ldquo;The root stamped while it is fresh and greene
and applied taketh away in one night or two at the most any
bruise, black or blew spots, gotten by falls or women&rsquo;s wilfulnesse
in stumbling upon their hasty husbands&rsquo; fists or such like.&rdquo; Of
cow parsnip he tells us: &ldquo;If a phrenticke or melancholicke man&rsquo;s
head bee anointed with oile wherein the leaves and roots have
been sodden, it helpeth him very much, and such as bee troubled
with the sickness called the forgetfull evill.&rdquo; Would any modern
have either the courage or the imagination to attempt to cure
&ldquo;the forgetfull evill&rdquo;? In the old Saxon herbals the belief
in the efficacy of herbs used as amulets is a marked feature,
and even in Gerard&rsquo;s Herbal much of this old belief survives.
&ldquo;A garland of pennyroyal,&rdquo; he tells us, &ldquo;made and worne about
the head is of a great force against the swimming in the head,
the paines and giddiness thereof.&rdquo; The root of spatling poppy
&ldquo;being pound with the leaves and floures cureth the stinging
of scorpions and such like venemous beasts: insomuch that
whoso doth hold the same in his hand can receive no damage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>108]</a></span>
or hurt by any venemous beast.&rdquo; Of shrubby trefoil we learn
that &ldquo;if a man hold it in his hand he cannot be hurt with the
biting of any venemous beast.&rdquo; Of rue he says: &ldquo;If a man be
anointed with the juice of rue, the poison of wolf&rsquo;s bane, mushrooms
or todestooles, the biting of serpents, stinging of scorpions,
spiders, bees, hornets and wasps will not hurt him.&rdquo; In the
older herbals numerous herbs are mentioned as being of special
virtue when used as amulets to protect the wayfaring man from
weariness, but Gerard mentions only two&mdash;mugwort and <i>Agnus
castus</i>. He quotes the authority of Pliny for the belief that
&ldquo;the traveller or wayfaring man that hath mugwort tied about
him feeleth no wearisomeness at all and he who hath it about
him can be hurt by no poysonous medecines, nor by any wilde
beaste, neither yet by the Sun itselfe.&rdquo; Of <i>Agnus castus</i> he
writes: &ldquo;It is reported that if such as journey or travell do
carry with them a branch or rod of agnus castus in their hand,
it will keep them from weariness.&rdquo; The herbs most in repute
as amulets against misfortune generally were angelica (of
sovereign virtue against witchcraft and enchantments) and
figwort, which was &ldquo;hanged about the necke&rdquo; to keep the
wearer in health. At times one feels that Gerard rather doubted
the efficacy of these &ldquo;physick charms,&rdquo; and he gives us a na&iuml;ve
description of his friends&rsquo; efforts to cure him of an ague by their
means.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Having a most grievous ague,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;and of long
continuance, notwithstanding Physick charmes, the little wormes
found in the heads of Teazle hanged about my necke, spiders
put in a walnut shell, and divers such foolish toies, that I was
constrained to take by fantasticke peoples procurement, notwithstanding
I say my helpe came from God himselfe, for these
medicines and all other such things did me no good at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Under &ldquo;gourd&rdquo; Gerard gives a use of this herb which, though
popular, is not to be found in any other English herbal. &ldquo;A
long gourd,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;or else a cucumber being laid in the
cradle or bed by the young infant while it is asleep and sicke of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>109]</a></span>
an ague, it shall very quickly be made whole.&rdquo; The cure was
presumably effected by the cooling properties of the fruit.
In another place he recommends the use of branches of willow
for a similar purpose. &ldquo;The greene boughes of willows with
the leaves may very well be brought into chambers and set
about the beds of those that be sick of fevers, for they do
mightily coole the heate of the aire, which thing is wonderfull
refreshing to the sicke Patient.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There is so much contemporary folk lore embodied in Gerard
that it is disappointing to find that when writing of mugwort,
a herb which has been endowed from time immemorial with
wonderful powers, he declines to give the old superstitions
&ldquo;tending to witchcraft and sorcerie and the great dishonour of
God; wherefore do I purpose to omit them as things unwoorthie
of my recording or your receiving.&rdquo; He also pours scorn on
the mandrake legend. &ldquo;There have been,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;many
ridiculous tales brought up of this plant, whether of old wives
or runnegate surgeons, or phisick mongers I know not, all whiche
dreames and old wives tales you shall from hencefoorth cast
out of your bookes of memorie.&rdquo; The old legend of the barnacle
geese, however, he gives fully. It is both too long and too well
known to quote, but it is interesting to remember that this
myth is at least as old as the twelfth century. According to
one version, certain trees growing near the sea produced fruit
like apples, each containing the embryo of a goose, which, when
the fruit was ripe, fell into the water and flew away. It is,
however, more commonly met with in the form that the geese
emanated from a fungus growing on rotting timber floating at
sea. This is Gerard&rsquo;s version. One of the earliest mentions of
this myth is to be found in Giraldus Cambrensis (<i>Topographia
Hiberni&aelig;</i>, 1187), a zealous reformer of Church abuses. In his
protest against eating these barnacle geese during Lent he
writes thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>110]</a></span>
&ldquo;There are here many birds which are called Bernacae
which nature produces in a manner contrary to nature and very
wonderful. They are like marsh geese but smaller. They are
produced from fir-timber tossed about at sea and are at first
like geese upon it. Afterwards they hang down by their beaks
as if from a sea-weed attached to the wood and are enclosed in
shells that they may grow the more freely. Having thus in
course of time been clothed with a strong covering of feathers
they either fall into the water or seek their liberty in the air by
flight. The embryo geese derive their growth and nutriment
from the moisture of the wood or of the sea, in a secret and most
marvellous manner. I have seen with my own eyes more than
a thousand minute bodies of these birds hanging from one piece
of timber on the shore enclosed in shells and already formed ...
in no corner of the world have they been known to build a nest.
Hence the bishops and clergy in some parts of Ireland are in the
habit of partaking of these birds on fast days without scruple.
But in doing so they are led into sin. For if anyone were to eat
the leg of our first parent, although he (Adam) was not born of
flesh, that person could not be adjudged innocent of eating flesh.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Jews in the Middle Ages were divided as to whether these
barnacle geese should be killed as flesh or as fish. Pope
Innocent III. took the view that they were flesh, for at the
Lateran Council in 1215 he prohibited the eating of them
during Lent. In 1277 Rabbi Izaak of Corbeil forbade them
altogether to Jews, on the ground that they were neither fish
nor flesh. Both Albertus Magnus and Roger Bacon derided
the myth, but in general it seems to have been accepted with
unquestioning faith. Sebastian Munster, in his <i>Cosmographia
Universalis</i> (1572), tells us that Pope Pius II. when on a visit
to Scotland was most anxious to see these geese, but was told
that they were to be found only in the Orkney Islands.
Sebastian believed in them himself, for he wrote of them:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;In Scotland there are trees which produce fruit conglomerated
of leaves, and this fruit when in due time it falls into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>111]</a></span>
the water beneath it is endowed with new life and is converted
into a living bird which they call the tree-goose.... Several
old cosmographers, especially Saxo Grammaticus, mention
the tree and it must not be regarded as fictitious as some new
writers suppose.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p></div>

<p>Even Hector Boece, in his <i>Hystory and Croniklis of Scotland</i>
(1536), took the myth seriously, but in his opinion &ldquo;the nature
of the seis is mair relevant caus of their procreation than ony
uther thyng.&rdquo; William Turner accepted the myth and gives
as his evidence what had been told him by an eye-witness, &ldquo;a
theologian by profession and an Irishman by birth, Octavian
by name,&rdquo; who promised him that he would take care that some
growing chicks should be sent to him! In later times we find
that Gaspar Schott (<i>Physica Curiosa Sive Mirabilia Natur&aelig; et
Artis</i>, 1662, lib. ix. cap. xxii. p. 960) quotes a vast number of
authorities on the subject and then demonstrates the absurdity
of the myth. Yet in 1677 Sir Robert Moray read before the
Royal Society &ldquo;A Relation concerning Barnacles,&rdquo; and this was
published in the <i>Philosophical Transactions</i>, January-February
1677-8. Among illustrations of the barnacle geese, that in de
l&rsquo;Obel&rsquo;s <i>Stirpium Historia</i> (1571) depicts the tree without the
birds. Gerard shows the tree with the birds; in Aldrovandus
leaves have been added to the tree and there is also an illustration
showing the development of the barnacles into geese.</p>

<p>As in all herbals the element of the unexpected is not lacking
in Gerard. Who would think of finding under the eminently
dull heading &ldquo;fir trees&rdquo; the following gem of folk lore? &ldquo;I
have seen these trees growing in Cheshire and Staffordshire and
Lancashire, where they grew in great plenty as is reported before
Noah&rsquo;s flood, but then being overturned and overwhelmed have
lien since in the mosse and waterie moorish grounds very fresh
and sound untill this day; and so full of a resinous substance,
that they burne like a Torch or Linke and the inhabitants of
those countries do call it Fir-wood and Fire-wood unto this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>112]</a></span>
day: out of the tree issueth the rosin called Thus, in English
Frankincense.&rdquo; In these days of exaggerated phraseology one
is the more appreciative of that word &ldquo;overturned.&rdquo; Gerard
mentions the famous white Thorn at Glastonbury, but he is
very cautious in his account of it. &ldquo;The white thorn at
Glastonbury ... which bringeth forth his floures about
Christmas by the report of divers of good credit, who have seen
the same; but myselfe have not seen it and therefore leave it
to be better examined.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another attractive feature of this Herbal is the preservation
in its pages of many old English names of plants. One species
of cudweed was called &ldquo;Live-for-ever.&rdquo; &ldquo;When the flower
hath long flourished and is waxen old, then comes there in the
middest of the floure a certain brown yellow thrumme, such as
is in the middest of the daisie, which floure being gathered
when it is young may be kept in such manner (I meane
in such freshnesse and well-liking) by the space of a whole
year after in your chest or elsewhere; wherefore our English
women have called it &lsquo;Live-long,&rsquo; or &lsquo;Live-for-ever,&rsquo; which
name doth aptly answer his effects.&rdquo; Another variety of cudweed
was called &ldquo;Herbe impious&rdquo; or &ldquo;wicked cudweed,&rdquo;
a variety &ldquo;like unto the small cudweed, but much larger and
for the most part those floures which appeare first are the lowest
and basest and they are overtopt by other floures, which come
on younger branches, and grow higher as children seeking to
overgrow or overtop their parents (as many wicked children
do), for which cause it hath been called &lsquo;Herbe impious.&rsquo;&rdquo;
Of the herb commonly known as bird&rsquo;s-eye he tells us: &ldquo;In
the middle of every small floure appeareth a little yellow spot,
resembling the eye of a bird, which hath moved the people of
the north parts (where it aboundeth) to call it Birds eyne.&rdquo;
&ldquo;The fruitful or much-bearing marigold,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;is likewise
called Jackanapes-on-horsebacke: it hath leaves, stalkes
and roots like the common sort of marigold, differing in the shape
of his floures; for this plant doth bring forth at the top of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>113]</a></span>
stalke one floure like the other marigolds, from which start
forth sundry other smal floures, yellow likewise and of the same
fashion as the first, which if I be not deceived commeth to pass
per accidens, or by chance, as Nature often times liketh to play
with other floures; or as children are borne with two thumbes
on one hand or such like, which living to be men do get children
like unto others: even so is the seed of this marigold, which
if it be sowen it brings forth not one floure in a thousand like
the plant from whence it was taken.&rdquo; Goat&rsquo;s-beard still retains
its old name of &lsquo;go-to-bed-at-noon,&rsquo; &ldquo;for it shutteth itselfe at
twelve of the clocke, and sheweth not his face open untill the
next dayes Sun doth make it flower anew, whereupon it was
called go-to-bed-at-noone: when these floures be come to their
full maturitie and ripenesse they grow into a downy Blow-ball
like those of dandelion, which is carried away with the winde.&rdquo;
Of the wild scabious (still called devil&rsquo;s-bit by country folk) he
tells us: &ldquo;It is called Devil&rsquo;s bit of the root (as it seemeth)
that is bitten off. Old fantasticke charmers report that the
Devil did bite it for envie because it is an herbe that hath so
many good vertues and is so beneficent to mankind.&rdquo; Gerard&rsquo;s,
again, is the only herbal in which we find one of the old names for
vervain: &ldquo;Of some it is called pigeons grasse because Pigeons
are delighted to be amongst it as also to eat thereof.&rdquo; Golden
moth-wort, he tells us, is called God&rsquo;s flower &ldquo;because the
images and carved gods were wont to wear garlands thereof: for
which purpose Ptolomy King of Egypt did most diligently
observe them as Pliny writeth. The floures ... glittering
like gold, in forme resembling the scaly floures of tansy or the
middle button of the floures of camomil, which, being gathered
before they be ripe or withered, remaine beautiful long after, as
myself did see in the hands of Mr. Wade, one of the Clerks of
her Majesties Counsell, which were sent him among other things
from Padua in Italy.&rdquo; The variety of daisy which children now
call &ldquo;Hen and Chickens&rdquo; was known as the &ldquo;childing daisy&rdquo;
in Gerard&rsquo;s time. &ldquo;Furthermore, there is another pretty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>114]</a></span>
double daisy which differs from the first described only in the
floure which at the sides thereof puts forth many foot-stalkes
carrying also little double floures, being commonly of a red
colour; so that each stalke carries as it were an old one and
the brood thereof: whence they have fitly termed it the childing
Daisie.&rdquo; Of silverweed he tells us: &ldquo;the later herbarists doe
call it argentine of the silver drops that are to be seen in the
distilled water thereof, when it is put into a glasse, which you
shall easily see rowling and tumbling up and downe in the
bottome.&rdquo; Delphinium, we learn, derives its name from
dolphin, &ldquo;for the floures especially before they be perfected
have a certain shew and likeness of those Dolphines which old
pictures and armes of certain antient families have expressed
with a crooked and bending figure or shape, by which signe also
the heavenly Dolphin is set forth.&rdquo; Rest-harrow, he says, is so
called &ldquo;because it maketh the Oxen whilest they be in plowing
to rest or stand still.&rdquo; One of the most attractive names which
he accounts for is cloudberry. &ldquo;Cloudberrie groweth naturally
upon the tops of two high mountaines (among the mossie places),
one in Yorkshire, called Ingleborough, the other in Lancashire
called Pendle, two of the highest mountains in all England,
where the clouds are lower than the tops of the same all winter
long, whereupon the country people have called them cloudberries;
found there by a curious gentleman in the knowledge
of plants, called Mr. Hesketh, often remembered.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For those who care to seek it Gerard supplies an unequalled
picture of the wild-flower life in London in Elizabethan days.
It is pleasant to think of the little wild bugloss growing &ldquo;in the
drie ditch bankes about Piccadilla&rdquo; (Piccadilly), of mullein
&ldquo;in the highwaies about Highgate&rdquo;; of clary &ldquo;in the fields of
Holborne neere unto Grays Inn&rdquo;; of lilies of the valley, the
rare white-flowered betony, devil&rsquo;s-bit, saw-wort, whortleberries,
dwarf willows and numerous other wild plants on
Hampstead Heath; of the yellow-flowered figwort &ldquo;in the
moist medowes as you go from London to Hornsey&rdquo;; of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>115]</a></span>
yellow pimpernel &ldquo;growing in abundance between Highgate
and Hampstead&rdquo;; of sagittaria &ldquo;in the Tower ditch at
London&rdquo;; of white saxifrage &ldquo;in the great field by Islington
called the Mantles and in Saint George&rsquo;s fields behinde Southwarke&rdquo;;
of the vervain mallow &ldquo;on the ditch sides on the left
hand of the place of execution by London called Tyburn and in
the bushes as you go to Hackney&rdquo;; of marsh-mallows &ldquo;very
plentifully in the marshes by Tilbury Docks&rdquo;; of the great
wild burnet &ldquo;upon the side of a causey, which crosseth a field
whereof the one part is earable ground and the other part medow,
lying between Paddington and Lysson Green neere unto London
upon the highway&rdquo;; of hemlock dropwort &ldquo;betweene the
plowed lands in the moist and wet furrowes of a field belonging
to Battersey by London, and amongst the osiers against York
House a little above the Horse-ferry against Lambeth&rdquo;; of
the small earth-nut &ldquo;in a field adjoyning to Highgate on the
right side of the middle of the village and likewise in the next
field and by the way that leadeth to Paddington by London&rdquo;;
of chickweed spurry &ldquo;in the sandy grounds in Tothill fields
nigh Westminster&rdquo;; of the pimpernel rose &ldquo;in a pasture as
you goe from a village hard by London called Knightsbridge
unto Fulham, a village thereby&rdquo;; of dwarf elder &ldquo;in untoiled
places plentifully in the lane at Kilburne Abbey by London&rdquo;;
of silver cinquefoil &ldquo;upon brick and stone walls about London,
especially upon the bricke wall in Liver Lane&rdquo;; of water-ivy,
&ldquo;which is very rare to find, nevertheless I found it once in a
ditch by Bermondsey house near to London and never elsewhere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The glimpses he gives us of London gardens are few and one
longs for more. It is remarkable how few vegetables, or &ldquo;pot-herbs&rdquo;
as they called them, were grown in Elizabethan times.
Vegetables which figured in the old Roman menus were considered
luxuries in this country even in the days of the later
Stuarts. The wild carrot is an indigenous plant in our islands,
but of the cultivated carrot we were ignorant till the Flemish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>116]</a></span>
immigrants introduced it in the early seventeenth century.
Parsnips, turnips and spinach were also rarities. With the
exception of the wild cabbage, the whole brassica tribe were
unknown to us till the late sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.
Potatoes and Jerusalem artichokes were both introduced into
this country in Tudor days. Gerard was one of the first to grow
potatoes, and he proudly tells us, &ldquo;I have received hereof from
Virginia roots which grow and prosper in my garden as in their
own native countrie.&rdquo; He was, in fact, the originator of the
popular but incorrect epithet &ldquo;Virginia potato.&rdquo; The potato
was not a native of Virginia, nor was it cultivated there in Tudor
times. The Spaniards brought it from Quito in 1580, and Gerard
had it in his garden as early as 1596. The potato to which
Shakespeare refers (<i>Troilus and Cressida</i>, V. ii. 534; <i>Merry
Wives of Windsor</i>, V. v. 20, 21) is, of course, the sweet potato,
which had been introduced into Europe nearly eighty years
earlier. Gerard speaks of this sweet potato as &ldquo;the common
potato,&rdquo; which is somewhat confusing to the modern reader.</p>

<p>There is a delightful glimpse of a well-known London garden,
that of &ldquo;Master Tuggie,&rdquo; who lived in Westminster and whose
hobby was gilliflowers. It is the more interesting to find this
passage in Gerard, for, as all lovers of Parkinson&rsquo;s <i>Paradisus</i> will
remember, some of the varieties of gilliflower were called after
their enthusiastic grower. Indeed, who can forget their enchanting
names&mdash;&ldquo;Master Tuggie&rsquo;s Princesse&rdquo; and &ldquo;Master
Tuggie his Rose gillowflower&rdquo;? Of gilliflowers, which vied
with roses in pride of place in Elizabethan gardens, Gerard
writes thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;Now I (holding it a thing not so fit for me to insist upon
these accidental differences of plants having specifique differences
enough to treat of) refer such as are addicted to these
commendable and harmless delights to survey the late and oft-mentioned
Worke of my friend, Mr. John Parkinson, who
hath accurately and plentifully treated of these varieties. If
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>117]</a></span>
they require further satisfaction, let them at the time of the
yeare repaire to the garden of Mistress Tuggie (the wife of my
late deceased friend, Mr. Ralph Tuggie) in Westminster, which
in the excellencie and varietie of these delights exceedeth all
that I have seene, as also, he himself, whilst he lived exceeded
most, if not all, of his time, in his care, industry and skill, in
raising, increasing and preserving of these plants.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Gerard&rsquo;s descriptions of the most loved English garden
flowers are perhaps too well known to quote, and therefore I
give only the following: &ldquo;The Plant of Roses, though it be a
shrub full of prickes, yet it hath beene more fit and convenient
to have placed it with the most glorious flowers of the world
than to inserte the same here among base and thornie shrubs;
for the rose doth deserve the chiefest and most principall place
among all flowers whatsoever being not only esteemed in his
beautie, vertue and his fragrance and odoriferous smell, but also
because it is the honor and ornament of our English Scepter,
as by the coniunction appeereth in the uniting of those two
most royal houses of Lancaster and Yorke. Which pleasant
flowers deserve the chiefest place in crowns and garlands. The
double white sort doth growe wilde in many hedges of Lancashire
in great abundance, even as briers do with us in these southerly
parts, especially in a place of the countrey called Leyland, and
in the place called Roughfoorde not far from Latham. The
distilled water of roses is good for the strengthening of the
hart and refreshing of the spirits and likewise in all things that
require a gentle cooling. The same being put in iunketting
dishes, cakes, sawces and many other pleasant things, giveth a
fine and delectable taste. It bringeth sleepe which also the
fresh roses themselves promote through their sweete and
pleasant smell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Like most gardeners Gerard was an optimist. It is wonderful
enough to think of the rare, white thyme growing in the
heart of London, but think of the courage of trying to raise
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>118]</a></span>
dates in the open! &ldquo;of the which,&rdquo; Gerard tells us (in no wise
downcast by his numerous failures), &ldquo;I have planted many
times in my garden and have growne to the height of three foot,
but the frost hath nipped them in such sort that soone after they
perished, notwithstanding my industrie by covering them, or
what else I could do for their succour.&rdquo; And does it not make
one feel as eager as Gerard himself when one finds, under water-mallows,
that, though exotic plants, &ldquo;at the impression hereof
I have sowen some seeds of them in my garden, expecting the
successe.&rdquo; The mere catalogue of the plants in Gerard&rsquo;s own
wonderful garden fills a small book, and scattered through the
Herbal we find numerous references to it, unfortunately too
lengthy to quote here.</p>

<p>One likes to think that Shakespeare must have seen this
garden, for we know that at least for a time he lived in the
vicinity. In those days two such prominent men could scarcely
have failed to know one another.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> As Canon Ellacombe has
pointed out, Shakespeare&rsquo;s writings are full of the old English
herb lore. In this use of plant lore, which was traditional rather
than literary, he is curiously distinct from his contemporaries.
Outside the herbals there is more old English herb lore to be
found in Shakespeare than in any other writer. It is, in fact,
incredible that the man whose own works are so redolent of the
fields and hedgerows of his native Warwickshire, did not visit
the garden of the most famous herbarist of his day. Perhaps
it was to Shakespeare that Gerard first told the sad tale of the
loss of his precious scammony of Syria, a tale which no one with
a gardener&rsquo;s heart can read without a pang of sympathy, even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>119]</a></span>
after the lapse of three centuries. One of his numerous correspondents
had sent him the seed of this rare plant, &ldquo;of which
seed,&rdquo; he says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;I received two plants that prospered exceeding well; the
one whereof I bestowed upon a learned apothecary of Colchester,
which continueth to this day bearing both floures and ripe seed.
But an ignorant weeder of my garden plucked mine up and cast
it away in my absence instead of a weed, by which mischance I
am not able to write hereof so absolutely as I determined. It
floured in my garden about S. James&rsquo; tide as I remember, for
when I went to Bristow Faire I left it in floure; but at my
returne it was destroyed as is aforesaid.&rdquo;</p>

Formerly it was generally supposed that Gerard&rsquo;s garden was on the
northern side of Holborn, but this is unlikely, for during the latter part of
Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign the part which is now known as Ely Place and Hatton
Garden was an estate of forty acres belonging to the Bishopric of Ely. Holborn
was almost a village then, and Gerard tells us in his <i>Herball</i> that in Gray&rsquo;s Inn
Lane he gathered mallow, shepherd&rsquo;s purse, sweet woodruff, bugle and Paul&rsquo;s
betony, and in the meadows near red-flowered clary, white saxifrage, the sad-coloured
rocket, yarrow, lesser hawkweed and the curious strawberry-headed
trefoil. Wallflower and golden stonecrop grew on the houses.</p>

Shakespeare and Gerard were near neighbours during the time when the
former was writing many of his finest plays, for Shakespeare lived in the
house of a Huguenot refugee (Mountjoy by name) 1598-1604. This house
was at the corner of Mugwell Street (now Monkswell Street) and Silver Street,
very near the site of the ancient palace of King Athelstan in Saxon days.
Almost opposite Mountjoy&rsquo;s house was the Barber-Surgeons&rsquo; Hall. Aggers&rsquo;
Map (<i>circ.</i> 1560) with pictures of the houses, gives an excellent idea of the
neighbourhood in those days. See also Leak&rsquo;s Map (1666).</p>

<p>To English folk and Americans alike the herbals&mdash;now
amongst the rarest in the English language&mdash;treating of the
virtues of herbs in the New World are of exceptional interest.
For these contain some of the earliest records of the uses of herbs
learnt from the Red Indians, lists of English weeds introduced
into America by the first settlers, and, perhaps most interesting
of all, what they grew in the first gardens in New England. It
requires very little imagination to realise how much the discovery
of the New World meant to the botanists, gardeners and
herbalists of that day, for at no time in our history were there
greater plant-lovers than in Elizabethan and Stuart times.
In their strenuous lives the soldiers, explorers and sea-captains
found time to send their friends in the Old World rare plants
and other treasures, and these gifts of &ldquo;rarities&rdquo; were cherished
as jewels. Is not the following a vivid picture of the arrival
of such a package from the New World? &ldquo;There came a
Paket, as of Letters, inrolled in a seare clothe: so well made that
thei might passe to any part beeyng never so farre, the whiche
beeyng opened, I founde a small Cheste made of a little peece
of Corke, of a good thickenesse sette together, whiche was
worthie to be seen, and in the holownesse of it came the hearbes,
and the seedes that the Letter speaketh of, everythyng written
what it was, and in one side of the Corke, in a hollowe place
there came three Bezaar stones, cloased with a Parchement and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>121]</a></span>
with Waxe in good order. The Letter was written with verie
small Letters, and sumwhat harde to reade.&rdquo; The letter and
the precious gift of herbs, seeds and stones were from an officer
on duty in &ldquo;New Spain&rdquo; (he describes himself as &ldquo;a Souldier
that have followed the warres in these countries all my life&rdquo;),
who was unknown to Monardes, but had read his first book on
the use of the herbs in the New World, and therefore was emboldened
to send him these rare plants and the &ldquo;bezaar stones.&rdquo;
Nicolas Monardes, the author of this herbal (translated into
English by John Frampton),<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> most gratefully acknowledges his
unknown friend&rsquo;s kindness and writes of him, &ldquo;the gentleman
of the Peru, which wrote to me this letter, although I know hym
not, it seemeth that he is a man curious and affectioned to the
like thinges and I have him in great estimation. For bicause
that the office of a Souldier is to handle weapons, and to sheed
bloud, and to do other exercises apertainyng to Souldiers, he is
muche to bee esteemed that he will enquire and searche out
herbes, and Plantes and to knowe their properties and vertue.
And therefore I dooe esteeme muche of this Gentlemanne for
the labour whiche he taketh in knowyng and enquiryng of these
naturall thinges. And I doe owe much unto him, ... I wil
provoke hym by writyng to hym againe, to sende more thinges.
For it is a greate thinge to knowe the secreates and marvailes
of nature, of the Hearbes which he hath sent me. I will make
experience of them and I will know their vertues and operation
and the Seedes wee will sowe at their time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The interest in the plant-life of the New World may be
judged from the fact that Monardes&rsquo;s work, which is the earliest
&ldquo;American&rdquo; herbal, was translated into Latin by no less a
botanist than Charles de l&rsquo;Escluse, and into Italian, Flemish,
French and English. Frampton&rsquo;s English translation went
through four editions. The original book was written nineteen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>122]</a></span>
years before the defeat of the Spanish Armada, and throughout
it there is very evident the pride of a Spanish subject in the
splendid overseas dominions of his country, then the first
empire in the world and the mistress of the seas. The preface
is so redolent of the atmosphere of Spanish galleons and the
boundless interest in the great new continent and its wonders,
that I quote it almost in full, although in modern print it loses
much of the charm of the original black-letter. The writer
surely had in his mind the account of the navy of Tharshish,
which came once in three years, &ldquo;bringing gold and silver,
ivory, and apes, and peacocks,&rdquo; and one cannot help suspecting
that loyalty to his Catholic Majesty of Spain suggested the
inclusion of lions from America in order that he might not be
outdone by the splendour of Solomon. Moreover, Monardes
proudly tells us that from the New World to Spain &ldquo;there
commeth every yere one hundred shippes laden ... that it is a
greate thynge and an incredle riches.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;In the yere of our Lorde God, a thousande, fower hundreth
ninetie twoo: our Spaniardes were gouerned by Sir Christofer
Colon [Columbus], beeyng naturally borne of the countrie
Genoa, for to discouer the Occidentall Indias, that is called at
this daie, the Newe Worlde, and thei did discouer the first lande
thereof, the XI daie of October, of the saied yere, and from that
tyme unto this, thei haue discouered many and sundrie Ilandes,
and muche firme Lande, as well in that countrie, whiche thei
call the Newe Spaine, as in that whiche is called the Peru,
where there are many Prouinces, many Kyngdomes, and many
Cities, that hath contrary and diuers customes in them, whiche
there hath been founde out, thynges that neuer in these partes,
nor in any other partes of the worlde hath been seen, nor unto
this daie knowen: and other thynges, whiche now are brought
unto us in greate aboundaunce, that is to saie, Golde, Siluer,
Pearles, Emeraldes, Turkeses [turquoises], and other fine stones
of greate value, yet greate is the excesse and quantitie that hath
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>123]</a></span>
come, and every daie doeth come, and in especiallie of Golde
and Siluer: That it is a thyng of admiration that the greate
number of Milleons, whiche hath come besides the greate
quantitie of Pearles, hath filled the whole worlde, also thei doe
bryng from that partes, Popingaies, Greffons, Apes, Lions,
Gerfaucons, and other kinde of Haukes, Tigers wolle, Cotton
wolle, Graine to die colours with all, Hides, Sugars, Copper,
Brasill, the woode Ebano, Anill: and of all these, there is so
greate quantitie, that there commeth every yere, one hundred
Shippes laden thereof, that it is a greate thynge and an incredle
riches.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And besides these greate riches, our Occidentall Indias
doeth sende unto us many Trees, Plantes, Herbes, Rootes,
Joices, Gummes, Fruites, Licours, Stones that are of greate
medicinall vertues, in the whiche there bee founde, and hath
been founde in them, verie greate effectes that doeth excede
muche in value and price: All that aforesaied, by so muche as
the Corporall healthe is more Excellent, and necessaire then the
temporall goodes, the whiche thynges all the worlde doeth
lacke, the wante whereof is not a little hurtfull, according to the
greate profite which wee doe see, by the use of them doeth
followe, not onely in our Spaine but in all the worlde.... The
people of old tyme did lacke them, but the tyme whiche is the
discouerer of all thynges, hath shewed them unto us greatly
to our profite, seying the greate neede that we had of them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And as there is discouered newe regions, newe Kyngdomes,
and newe Prouinces, by our Spanyardes, thei haue brought unto
us newe Medicines, and newe Remedies, wherewith thei doe cure
and make whole many infirmities, whiche if wee did lacke them,
thei were incurable, and without any remedie, the whiche
thynges although that some have knowledge of them, yet thei
bee not common to all people, for whiche cause I did pret&#275;de
to treate and to write, of all thynges, that thei bryng from our
Indias, whiche serueth for the arte and use of Medicine, and the
remedy of the hurtes and deseases, that wee doe suffer and

shall be the first, that the rather the followers maie adde hereunto,
with this beginnyng, that whiche thei shall more knowe,
and by experience shall finde. And, as in this Citee of Seuill,
which is the Porte and skale of all Occidentall Indias, wee
doe knowe of th&#275; more, then in any other partes of all Spaine,
for because that all thynges come first hither, where with better
relation, and greater experience it is knowen. I doe it with
experience and use of them this fourtie yeres, that I doe cure
in this Citee, where I haue informed myself of them, that hath
brought these thynges out of those partes with muche care,
and I have made with all diligence and foresight possible, and
with much happie successe.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Then he begins straightway to tell us of various herbs and
gums brought from the New World, and of what the herbalists
had been able to learn of their medicinal virtues. He writes
of &ldquo;Copall&rdquo; and &ldquo;Anime&rdquo; (varieties of rosin), and tells us that
the Spaniards first learnt of these from the Indian priests, who
&ldquo;went out to receive them [the Spaniards] with little firepottes,
burnyng in them this Copall, and giuing to them the smoke of
it at their noses.&rdquo; &ldquo;Tacamahaca&rdquo; (the Indian name for a
rosin) is &ldquo;taken out by incision of a tree beyng as greate as a
Willowe Tree, and is of a verie sweete smell; he doeth bryng
forth a redde fruite, as the seede of Pionia.&rdquo; The Indians
used it for swellings in any part of the body and also for toothache.
&ldquo;Caranna,&rdquo; another gum brought from Nombre de
Dios, is discovered to be of sovereign virtue for gout&mdash;&ldquo;it
taketh it awaie with muche easines.&rdquo; The balsam of the New
World, &ldquo;that licour most excellent whiche for his Excellencie
and meruerlous effectes is called Balsamo, an imitation of the
true Balsamo that was in the lande of Egipt,&rdquo; is &ldquo;made of a
tree greater than a Powndgarned Tree, it carrieth leaues like to
Nettles: the Indians doe call it Xilo and we do call the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>125]</a></span>
Balsamo.&rdquo; There follows an account of the way in which the
Red Indians made the balsam, either by cutting incisions in
the tree and letting the &ldquo;clammish licour, of colour white but
most excellent and very perfite,&rdquo; run out, or by cutting up
boughs and branches of the tree into very small pieces, boiling
them in cauldrons and then skimming off the oil. &ldquo;It is not
convenient, nor it ought to be kept in any other vessel then in
silver (glasse or Tinne or any other thing glassed, it doth penetrate
and doth passe through it), the use thereof is onely in
thinges of Medecine and it hath been used of long tyme ...
the Spaniards had knowledge of it because they did heale therwith
the woundes that they did receive of the Indians: beyng
advised of the vertue thereof by the same Indians, and they did
see the saide Indians heale and cure themselves therewith.&rdquo;
We learn that when this precious new balsam was first brought
to Spain it sold for ten ducats an ounce, and in Italy for a
hundred ducats an ounce. The use of another wound herb, &ldquo;for
shottes of arrows,&rdquo; of which unfortunately he does not give
even the Indian name, was taught to a certain &ldquo;Jhon Infante&rdquo;
by his native servant. The book gives us many pleasant
glimpses of the kindly courtesy of the Red Indians to their foes,
and though, according to some authorities, they would never
tell the secrets of the herbs they used as medicines, we have
Monardes&rsquo;s detailed accounts of how they showed the Spaniards
the uses of them. Guiacum, for instance, was brought to the
notice of a Spaniard in San Domingo by an Indian doctor.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting accounts is of &ldquo;Mechoacan.&rdquo;
&ldquo;It is brought from a countrie that is beyonde the greate Citie
of Mexico more than fortie leagues, that is called Mechoacan,
the whiche Syr Fernando Curtes did conquer in the yere of 1524,
it is a countrie of muche Riches, of Gold and chiefly of Silver ...
those Mynes be so celebrated and of so muche riches that they
be called the Cacatecas, every day they goe discovering in the
Lande verie riche Mynes of Silver and some of Golde, it is a
countrie of good and holsome ayres, and doth bring forth healthfull
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>126]</a></span>
Hearbes for to heale many diseases, in so muche that at
the tyme the Indians had the government of it, the inhabiters
there rounde aboute that Province, came thether to heale
their diseases and infirmities.... The Indians of that countrie
be of a taller growthe and of better faces then the Borderers are
and of more healthe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The principall place of that province the Indians doe call
in their language Chincicila and the Spaniards doe call it as thei
call that realme Mechoacan, and it is a great towne of Indians,
situated nere to a lake which is of swete water and of verie
muche Fishe, the same Lake is like the fashion of making an
horse shewe, and in the middest thereof standeth the Towne,
the whiche at this daye hath greate trade of buying and
sellyng.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We are told in detail how the Warden of the Friars of
St. Francis was cured by a native Indian doctor with this
herb&mdash;&ldquo;mechoacan&rdquo;:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As soone as that Province was gotten of the Indians there
went thither certaine Friers, of Saincte Frances order, and as in a
countrie so distant from their naturall soyle, some of them
fell sicke, amongest whom the Warden, who was the Chief Frier
of the house fell sicke, with whom Caconcin Casique, an Indian
lord, a man of great power in that countrie, had very greate
friendship, who was Lorde of all that countrie. The father
Warden had a long sicknes and put to muche danger of life,
the Casique as he sawe his disease procede forward, he saied
that he would bryng hym an Indian of his, which was a Phisition,
with whom he did cure hym self, and it might bee that
he would give hym remeady of his disease. The whiche beeyng
heard of the Frier, and seyng the little helpe that he had there,
and the want of a Phisition, and other thynges of benefite, he
thanked hym and saied unto hym, that he should bryng hym
unto hym: who beyng come, and seyng his disease, he said to
the Casique, that if he tooke a pouder that he would giue hym
of a roote, that it would heale hym. The whiche beeyng knowen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>127]</a></span>
to the Frier, with the desire that he had of healthe, he did accepte
his offer and tooke the pouder that the Indian Physition gave
hym the nexte daie in a little Wine.... He was healed of his
infirmitie and the rest of the Friers which were sicke did followe
the father Warden&rsquo;s cure and took of the Self same powder
once or twice and as ofte as thei had neede of for to heale them.
The use of the whiche went so well with them that the Friers
did send relation of this to the Father Provincall to Mexico
where he was: who did communicate with those of the countrie,
giving to them of the roote, and comforting them that thei
should take it, because of the good relation that he had from
those Friers of Mechoacan. The whiche beyng used of many
and seyng the marueilous woorkes that it did the fame of it was
extended all abrode, that in short tyme all the countrie was
full of his good woorkes and effectes, banishing the use of
Ruibarbe of Barbarie and taking his name, naming it Ruibarbo
of the Indos and so all men dooeth commonly call it. And also
it is called Mechoaca for that it is brought from thence....
And so thei do carry it from the Newe Spaine as Merchandise
of very great price.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The plant itself Monardes describes thus:&mdash;&ldquo;It is an herbe
that goeth creepyng up by certaine little Canes, it hath a sadde
greene coulour, he carrieth certaine leaues, that the greatnesse
of them maie bee of the greatnesse of a good potenge dishe, that
is in compasse rounde, with a little point, the leaffe hath his
little Senewes, he is small, well nere without moisture, the stalke
is of the coulour of a cleare Taunie. Thei saie that he dooeth
caste certaine clusters, with little Grapes, of the greatnesse of
a Coriander seede, whiche is his fruite and dooeth waxe ripe by
the Monethe of September: he doeth caste out many bowes,
the whiche doeth stretche a long up&#333; the yearth, and if you doe
put anythyng nere to it, it goeth creepyng upon it. The roote
of the Mechoacan is unsaverie and without bightyng or any
sharpness of taste.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The book was published in successive parts, and the second
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>128]</a></span>
of these, dedicated to the King of Spain, contains the first written
account and illustration of &ldquo;the hearbe tabaco.&rdquo; Monardes tells
us that this herb was one &ldquo;of much antiquity&rdquo; amongst the
Indians, who taught the Spaniards to use it as a wound-herb.
It was first introduced into Spain &ldquo;to adornate Gardens with
the fairenesse thereof and to give a pleasant sight, but nowe
we doe use it more for his meruelous medicinable vertues than
for his fairenesse.&rdquo; The Red Indians called it &ldquo;picielt.&rdquo;
(The name tabaco was given it by the Spaniards, either from
the island which still bears the name Tobago, as Monardes
declares, or from a native word connected in some way with
the use of the dried leaves for smoking.) According to Monardes
the leaves, when warmed and laid on the forehead with orange
oil, were efficacious to cure headaches. They were also good
for toothache. &ldquo;When the griefe commeth of a cold cause or
of colde Rumes, putting to the tooth a little ball made of the
leafe of the Tabaco, washing first the tooth with a smal cloth
wet in the Juyce, it stayeth it, that the putrifaction goe not
forwarde: and this remedie is so common that it healeth euerie
one.&rdquo; Of greater interest is the account of its application as a
wound-herb and of an experiment made on a small dog at the
Spanish Court.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;A little whiles past, certain wilde people going in their
Bootes [boats] to S. John De puerto Rico to shoote at Indians
or Spaniards (if that they might find them) came to a place
and killed certain Indians and Spaniards and did hurt many,
and as by chance there was no Sublimatum at that place to
heale them, they remembered to lay upon the wounds the Juice
of the Tabaco and the leaves stamped. And God would, that
laying it upon the hurts, the griefs, madnes, and accidents
wherewith they died were mittigated, and in such sorte they
were delivered of that euill that the strength of the Venom was
taken away and the wounds were healed, of the which there
was great admiration. Which thing being knowen to them of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>129]</a></span>
the Islande they use it also in other hurtes and wounds, which
they take when they fight with the wilde people: nowe they stand
in no feare of them, by reason they have founde so great a
remedie in a case so desperate. This Hearbe hath also vertue
against the hearbe called of the Crosse boweshooter, which our
hunters doe use to kill the wilde beastes withall and which
hearbe is Venom most stronge, and doeth kill without remedie,
which the Kinges pleasure was to prooue and commanded to
make experience thereof, and they wounded a little dogge in
the throate, and put forthwith into the wound the hearbe of
the Crosse boweshooter, and after a little whyle, they powred
into the self same wound that they had annointed with the
Crosse boweshooters hearbe, a good quantitie of the juice of
Tabaco and layde the stamped leaves upon it and they tied up
the dogge and he escaped, not without great admiration of all
men that saw him. Of the which the excellent Phisition of
the Chamber of his Maiestie, Doctor Barnarde in the margent
of this booke, that sawe it, by the commaundement of his
Maiestie, writeth these wordes&mdash;&lsquo;I made this experience by
the commaundement of the Kinges Maiesty. I wounded the
dogge with a knife and after I put the Crosse boweshooters
hearbe into the wound and the hearbe was chosen and the dogge
was taken of the hearbe, and the Tabaco and his Juyce being
put into the wounde the dogge escaped and remained whole.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="caption">ILLUSTRATIONS OF SASSAFRAS AND TOBACCO FROM NICOLAS MONARDES&rsquo; &ldquo;JOYFULL NEWES OUT OF THE
NEWE FOUNDE WORLDE&rdquo; (1577)</p>

<p class="subcapt">(The figure of tobacco is the first printed illustration of that plant to appear in an English book)</p>

<p>We are further given an exceptionally interesting account of
the use of tobacco in the religious ceremonies of the Red Indians.
&ldquo;One of the meruelles of this hearbe and that whiche bringeth
most admiration is the maner howe the Priests of the Indias
did use it, which was in this maner: when there was amongst
the Indians any maner of businesse of great importaunce, in the
whiche the chiefe Gentleman called Casiques or any of the
principall poople [people] of the Countrey had necessitie to
consult with their Priestes in any businesse of importaunce:
then they went and propounded their matter to their chiefe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>130]</a></span>
Priest, foorthwith in their presence he tooke certeyne leaues
of the Tabaco and cast them into ye fire and did receive the
smoke of them at his mouth and at his nose with a Cane, and
in taking of it he fell downe uppon the ground as a Dead man,
and remayning so according to the quantity of the smoke that
he had taken, when the hearbe had done his woorke he did
revive and awake, and gave them then aunsweares [answers]
according to the visions, and illusions whiche he sawe, whiles
he was rapte in the same maner, and he did interprete to them
as to him seemed best, or as the Divell had counselled him, giuing
them continually doubtfull aunsweres in such sorte that howsoever
it fell out, they might say that it was the same whiche
was declared and the aunswere that he made.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In like sort the rest of the Indians for their pastime do
take the smoke of the Tabaco, to make themselves drunke
withall, and to see the visions, and things that represent unto
them, that wherein they do delight: and other times they take
it to know their businesse and successe, because conformable
to that whiche they haue seene, being drunke therewith, euen
so they iudge of their businesse. And as the devil is a deceuer
and hath the knowledge of the vertue of hearbs, so he did shew
the vertue of this Hearb, that by the meanes thereof, they might
see their imaginations and visions, that he hath represented unto
them and by that meanes deceiue them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Red Indians also used this herb when they were obliged
to travel for several days &ldquo;in a dispeopled countrie where they
shal finde neither water nor meate.&rdquo; They rolled the leaves
into small balls, which they put &ldquo;betweene the lower lippe and
the teeth and goe chewing it all the time that they trauell
and that whiche they chew they swallow downe and in this sort
they journey three or foure dayes without hauing neede of meate
or drink, for they feele no hunger nor weaknesse nor their trauel
doth trouble them.&rdquo; (This custom Monardes compares to that
of the bear, which during the winter &ldquo;remaineth in his Caue and
liueth without meate or drink, with onely chewing his pawes&rdquo;!)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>131]</a></span>
On its first introduction into Europe tobacco seems to have
been regarded as a new all-heal, and in the city of Seville,
we read, &ldquo;they know not what other to doe, hauing cut or hurt
themselves but to run to the Tabaco as to a most readie remedie.
It doth meruellous workes, without any need of other Surgery,
but this only hearbe.&rdquo; One chapter is devoted entirely to an
account of various cures effected by tobacco, and it is interesting
to read the authoritative account of the origin of the botanical
name &ldquo;Nicotiana.&rdquo; Monardes tells us that it was so called
after Nicot, &ldquo;my very friend ye first author inventer and bringer
of this hearbe into France.&rdquo; It appears that &ldquo;Maister John
Nicot, being Embassador for his Maiestie in Portugall, in the
yeere of our Lorde 1559, went one day to see the Prysons of
the King of Portugall, and a Gentleman, being the Keeper of
the said Prysons, presented him with this hearb as a strange
plant brought from Florida.&rdquo; The same Maister Nicot, &ldquo;hauing
caused the said hearb to be set in his Garden, where it grewe
and multiplyed maruellously,&rdquo; experimented with it, and
amongst other things cured a young man who had a sore on his
nose. Quite a number of cures were effected, the most interesting
being that of one of Nicot&rsquo;s own cooks, who &ldquo;hauing almost
cutte off his thombe with a great Chopping Knife ran unto the
said Nicotiane and healed it&rdquo;!</p>

<p>The prescription for the ointment of tobacco is as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;Take
a pounde of the freshe leaues of the sayde Hearbe,
stampe them, and mingle them with newe Waxe, Rosine,
common oyle of each three ounces, let them boyle altogether,
untill the Juice of Nicotiane be consumed, then add therto
three ounces of Venise Turpentine, straine the same through
a Linen cloth, and keepe it in Pottes to your use.&rdquo; The account
of tobacco ends thus:&mdash;&ldquo;Loe here you haue the true Historie
of Nicotiane of the which the sayde Lorde Nicot, one of the
Kinge&rsquo;s Counsellors, first founder out of this hearbe, hath made
me privie, as well by woorde as by writing, to make thee (friendly
Reader) partaker thereof, to whome I require thee to yeeld
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>132]</a></span>
as harty thankes as I acknowledge myself bound unto him for
this benefite received.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We find that the Indians first taught the Spaniards the
use of sassafras, and &ldquo;the Spaniards did begin to cure themselves
with the water of this tree and it did in them greate effectes,
that it is almost incredible: for with the naughtie meates and
drinkyng of the rawe waters, and slepyng in the dewes, the
moste parte of them came to fall into continuall Agues.... Thei
tooke up the roote of this Tree and tooke a peece thereof suche
as it seemed to theim beste, thei cutte it small into verie thinne
and little peeces and cast them into water at discretion, little
more or lesse, and thei sodde it the tyme that seemed nedefull
for to remaine of a good colour, and so thei dranke it in the
mornyng fastyng and in the daie tyme and at dinner and supper,
without kepyng any more waight or measure, then I have
saied, nor more keepyng, nor order then this, and of this thei
were healed of so many griefes and euill diseases. That to heare
of them what thei suffred and how thei were healed it doeth
bryng admiration and thei whiche were whole dranke it in place
of wine, for it doeth preserue them in healthe: As it did appeare
verie well by theim, that hath come fr&#333; thence this yere, for
thei came all whole and strong, and with good coulours, the
whiche doeth not happen to them that dooeth come from those
partes and from other conquestes, for thei come sicke and swolne,
without collour, and in shorte space the moste of theim dieth:
and these souldiours doeth trust so muche in this woodde that
I beyng one daie amongest many of them, informing myself
of the thynges of this Tree, the moste parte of them tooke out
of their pokettes a good peece of this woodd, and said: &lsquo;Maister,
doe you see here the woodde, that euery one of us doth bryng
for to heale us with all, if we do fall sicke, as we haue been
there,&rsquo; and they began to praise so muche, to confirme the
meruelous workes of it, with so many examples of them that
were there, that surely I gave greate credite unto it and thei
caused me to beleeve all that thereof I had heard, and gave me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>133]</a></span>
courage to experimente it as I have doen.&rdquo; There is another
vivid glimpse of the use of sassafras as a pomander when the
pestilence was rife in Seville. &ldquo;Many did use to carrie a peece
of the Roote of the wood with them to smell to it continually,
as to a Pomander. For with his smell so acceptable it did
rectifie the infected ayre: I caried with mee a peece a greate
tyme, and to my seemyng I founde greate profite in it. For
with it and with the chewing of the rinde of lemmon in the
mornyng and in the daye tyme for to preserve health it hath a
greate strength and property. It seemeth to mee that I was
delivered by the healpe of God from the fyre in the whiche we
that were Phisitions went in, blessed be our Lorde God that
delivered us from so great euill and gave us this moste excellente
Tree called Sassafras, which hath so greate vertues, and doth
suche maruellous effectes as we have spoken of and more that
the tyme will shewe us, which is the discouerer of all thinges.&rdquo;</p>


<p class="hrpad">It is a far cry from Monardes&rsquo;s book to that by &ldquo;John
Josselyn Gentleman,&rdquo; written nearly a hundred years later.
Instead of the atmosphere of the El Dorado of the Spanish Main,
of the galleons, of the tropical sun and plants of the West Indies,
we find ourselves in the good company of the first settlers in
New England, the Spanish Empire being only a memory of the
past. Just fifty years after the landing of the Pilgrim Fathers
on American soil, <i>New England&rsquo;s Rarities discovered</i> was printed
at the Green Dragon in St. Paul&rsquo;s Churchyard, London, and the
book is of peculiar interest, for it contains the first published
lists of English plants that would thrive in America. There
is a certain pathos in the efforts of the new settlers to produce
in the New Country (which then took two months to reach)
something that would remind them of the familiar English
gardens of their old homes, and no one with a gardener&rsquo;s heart
can read it without sympathy. The book was written by one
John Josselyn, who undertook the then perilous voyage in order
to stay with his only brother, who lived a hundred leagues from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>134]</a></span>
Boston. There he remained about eight years, making it
his business to collect all the information he could about plants
that interested him. Even as late as 1663 the country was
very imperfectly explored, for he gravely informs the reader
that he cannot say whether New England is an island or not.
He is not very sure whether even America is an island, but is
confident that the Indians are closely allied to the Tartars.</p>

<p>But to turn to the subject-matter of the book. First we
have a careful list of plants which the author found and which
were common in England also, and&mdash;what is quite delightful&mdash;notes
on the uses made of these plants by the Red Indians.
For instance, they used white hellebore to cure their wounds,
and John Josselyn tells us exactly how. They first rubbed
racoon&rsquo;s grease or wild cat&rsquo;s grease on the wounds and then
strewed the dried and powdered root on to it. They also applied
the powdered root for toothache. Under the yellow-flowered
water-lily we find a note to the effect that the Indians used
the roots for food, and Josselyn seems to have tried them himself,
for he says that they taste of sheep&rsquo;s liver. &ldquo;The Moose
Deer,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;feed much on them and the Indians choose
this time when their heads are under water to kill them.&rdquo; From
acorns the Indians made the oil with which they rubbed themselves.
This was prepared by burning rotten maple wood to
ashes and then boiling acorns with these ashes till the oil floated
on the top. Of American walnuts and violets he had apparently
a poor opinion, for he describes the walnuts as being not much
bigger than a nutmeg and &ldquo;but thinly replenished with kernels,&rdquo;
and the violets as inferior to the English &ldquo;Blew Violet.&rdquo; The
most interesting of the recipes is that for the beer which he used
to brew for Indians who came to him when they had bad colds.
New Englanders who still possess treasured old housewives&rsquo;
books will probably find they have recipes for the same kind
of beer; for it is typical of that commonly made in England in
the seventeenth century and is strangely flavoured with elecampane,
liquorice, sassafras, aniseed, and fennel seed. Then follows
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>135]</a></span>
a list of plants peculiar to New England, with a long description
of &ldquo;Indian wheat,&rdquo; of which &ldquo;the Flower [flour] makes
excellent Puddens.&rdquo; Another plant described at length is
the hollow-leaved lavender, but it is difficult to identify it
from the illustration. The most interesting part of this list is
that consisting of plants to which no English names had yet
been given.</p>

<p>It is hard to believe that before the Pilgrim Fathers landed
some of the commonest weeds were unknown in their new country.
Yet we have John Josselyn&rsquo;s list of these, and it includes couch-grass,
shepherd&rsquo;s purse, dandelion, groundsel, sow-thistle, stinging-nettle,
mallows, plantain, wormwood, chickweed, mullein,
knot-grass and comfrey. The plantain, one always learnt as a
child, follows the English colonist wherever he goes, and there
is curious confirmation in Josselyn&rsquo;s note that the Indians
called this familiar weed &ldquo;&lsquo;Englishman&rsquo;s Foot,&rsquo; as though it were
produced by their treading.&rdquo; But the most fascinating list
of all is that of the English garden-plants which those early
settlers tried to grow, and it is impossible to read it without
realising the loving care which must have been lavished on the
southernwood, rosemary, lavender, and other plants imported
from English gardens, which survived the long journey only
to succumb to the rigours of the New England winter. There
is something so na&iuml;ve and appealing about this list, the first
gardening link, as it were, between England and America, that
I give it in full as it stands in the original:</p>

<p>The book ends in a delightfully irrelevant fashion with a poem
on an Indian squaw, introduced as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;Now, gentle
Reader, having trespassed upon your patience a long while
in the perusing of these rude Observations, I shall, to make you
amends, present you by way of Divertisement, or Recreation,
with a Copy of Verses on the Indian Squa or Female Indian
trick&rsquo;d up in all her bravery.&rdquo;</p>


<p class="hrpad"><i>The American Physitian; or a Treatise of the Roots, Plants,
Trees, Shrubs, Fruit, Herbs, etc., growing in the English
Plantations in America</i>,<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> has, as its name implies, more of a
medical character than the older books. In his preface the
writer, William Hughes, tells us:&mdash;&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis likely some may say
need we trouble ourselves with those things we cannot reach?
To such I answer, that the most part of them here mentioned
which grow not in England already are brought over daily
and made use of.... I suppose there are few but would
gladly know that there are such things in the world, although
scarcely any which care or desire to go to see them; I hope
this Description which is as right to truth as I could possibly
draw it, if my eyesight failed me not, may be acceptable,
although it be far short of what I intended; it being my desire
to have made it more compleat by one more voyage into those
parts of the World, in which my endeavours should not have
been found wanting for the bringing and fitting of Roots, Seeds
and other Vegetables to our climate, for, to increase the number
of Rarities which we have here in our Garden already; in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>138]</a></span>
which I perceive much may be done, if further industry were
used, but I have yet met with no opportunity to accomplish
the same; and therefore hope that some others who have conveniency
will do something herein for the promotion of further
knowledge in these and many other excellent things which those
parts afford, and we are yet unacquainted with. And whosoever
is offended at this that I have here written, may let it alone;
it forceth none to meddle with it: I know the best things displease
some, neither was there ever any man yet that could
please all people: but in hurting none, possibly I may please
some; for whom only it is intended.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The book itself contains interesting accounts of yams,
gourds, potatoes, prickly pears, maize (of turkeys fed on maize
he says, &ldquo;If I should tell how big some of their turkeys are I
think I should hardly be believed&rdquo;), cotton, pepper and sugar.
His dissertation on the making of sugar is one of the earliest
accounts of the process. Of the &ldquo;Maucaw tree&rdquo; he writes
that &ldquo;the seeds being fully ripe are of a pure crimson or reddish
colour apt to dye the skin with a touch so that it cannot quickly
be washed off.&rdquo; The Red Indians used these seeds to dye their
skins, and Hughes remarks, &ldquo;were some Ladies acquainted
with this Rarity, doubtless they would give much for it.&rdquo; The
longest section of the book deals with the cacao tree, its fruit
and the making of chocolate. Cacao kernels were used as tokens
and cacao plantations were entailed property. &ldquo;In Carthagena,
New Spain and other adjacent places, they do not only entail
their Cacao Walks or Orchards on their Eldest Sons, as their
Right of Inheritance (as Lands here in England are settled on
the next Heir), but these cacao kernels have been, and are
in so great esteem with them, that they pass between man and
man for any merchandise, in buying and selling in the Markets,
as the most current silver Coyn; as I have been told and as
some credible Writers do affirm.&rdquo; There is a notable description
of the making of chocolate by the servants &ldquo;before they go
forth to work in the Plantations in a morning and without which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>139]</a></span>
they are not well able to perform their most laborious employments
in the Plantations, or work with any great courage until
eleven a clock, their usual time of going to Dinner.&rdquo; A detailed
account of the preparation of the drink ends with this vivid
picture: &ldquo;and then taking it off the Fire they pour it out
of the Pot into some handsome large Dish or Bason: and after
they have sweetened it a little with Sugar, being all together
and sitting down round about it like good Fellows, everyone dips
in his Calabash or some other Dish, supping it off very hot.&rdquo;
He describes all sorts of ways of using the chocolate, the best in
his opinion being that of the &ldquo;Maroonoes Hunters and such as
have occasion to travel the Country.&rdquo; They made it into
&ldquo;lozanges,&rdquo; which &ldquo;exceed a Scotch-man&rsquo;s provision of Oat-meal
and Water, as much (in my opinion) as the best Ox-beef
for strong stomacks exceeds the meanest food.&rdquo; Chocolate,
it will be remembered, became a very fashionable drink in
England in the seventeenth century, but Hughes considers
it inferior to the genuine stuff made in the Plantations.
In fact, he cautions English people to procure their chocolate
straight from Jamaica, and then to see themselves to the making
of it according to his directions!</p>


<p class="hrpad">In spite of its impressive name, <i>The South-Sea Herbal
containing the names, use, etc. of divers medicinal plants lately
discovered by Pere L. Feuillee, one of the King of France&rsquo;s
herbalists ... much desired and very necessary to be known
of all such as now traffick to the South-Seas or reside in those
parts</i> (1715), is only eight pages long, five of which are devoted
to figures of the plants. Nevertheless this now rare little
pamphlet is valuable inasmuch as it is probably the first account
in English of the medicinal plants of Peru and Chili. The writer&mdash;James
Petiver&mdash;began life by serving his apprenticeship
to Mr. Feltham, apothecary to St. Bartholomew&rsquo;s Hospital,
London. He afterwards qualified as apothecary and became
demonstrator of plants to the Society of Apothecaries. All
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>140]</a></span>
his life he seems to have been rather a recluse, devoting his time
to the study of natural history specimens sent him from all parts
of the world. His herbarium, now in the Sloane Collection in the
Victoria and Albert Museum, South Kensington, is exceptionally
interesting, for Petiver appears to have had friends in all parts
of the world, mostly sea-captains, who took delight in sending
him treasures. The value of his collection may be judged from
the fact that shortly before his death, Sir Hans Sloane offered
him &pound;4000 for it. His <i>South-Sea Herbal</i> is purely medicinal,
except for an appeal to anyone living in Quito who &ldquo;would be
pleased to procure branches of the leaves of Jesuits&rsquo; Bark or
Quinquina with its Flowers and Fruit, which Favour should be
acknowledged and more accurate Figures given of each if communicated
to your humble servant.&rdquo; There is unfortunately
now no copy extant of another of Petiver&rsquo;s pamphlets, <i>The
Virtues of several Sovereign Plants found wild in Maryland with
Remarks on them</i>. Apparently not many were printed, for
there is a note to this effect at the end of the advertisement:
&ldquo;Divers of these Tracts are now so very scarce that of some of
them there are not 20 left.&rdquo; Owing to the fact that nearly
every page of illustrations in Petiver&rsquo;s works is dedicated to
some friend who had sent him specimens, we have preserved
for us the record of his numerous correspondents. These
dedications are very pleasant reading:&mdash;</p>

</div>


<p>The last of the great English herbalists was John Parkinson,
the author of the famous <i>Paradisus</i> and also of the largest herbal
in the English language, <i>Theatrum Botanicum</i>, which was published
when the author was seventy-three. The latter was intended to
be a complete account of medicinal plants and was the author&rsquo;s
most important work, yet it is with the <i>Paradisus</i> (strictly not
a herbal, but a gardening book), that his name is popularly
associated. Of Parkinson himself we can learn very little. We
know only that he was born in 1567, probably in Nottinghamshire,
and that before 1616 he was practising as an apothecary and had
a garden in Long Acre &ldquo;well stored with rarities.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> He was
appointed Apothecary to James I., and after the publication of
his <i>Paradisus</i> in 1629 Charles I. bestowed on him the title of
Botanicus Regius Primarius. Amongst Parkinson&rsquo;s acquaintances
mentioned in his books were the learned Thomas Johnson, who
in 1633 emended and brought out a new edition of Gerard&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>143]</a></span>
<i>Herball</i>, John Tradescant,<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> the famous gardener, traveller and
naturalist, and the celebrated physician, Sir Theodore Mayerne.
Parkinson died in 1650 and was buried at St. Martin&rsquo;s in the
Fields. There is a portrait of him in his sixty-second year
prefixed to his <i>Paradisus</i>, and a small portrait by Marshall at
the bottom of the title-page of his <i>Theatrum Botanicum</i>.</p>

<p>The full title of Parkinson&rsquo;s <i>Paradisus</i>, which in the dedicatory
letter to Queen Henrietta Maria he truly describes as &ldquo;this
Speaking Garden,&rdquo; is inscribed on a shield at the bottom of the
frontispiece. The first three words, &ldquo;Paradisi in Sole,&rdquo; are a
punning translation into Latin of his own surname.</p>

<p>At the top of the page is the Eye of Providence with a Hebrew
inscription, and on each side a cherub symbolising the winds.
In the centre is a representation of Paradise with Adam grafting
an apple tree and Eve running downhill to pick up a pineapple.
The flowers depicted are curiously out of proportion, for the tulip
flower is a good deal larger than Eve&rsquo;s head, and cyclamen in
Paradise seems to have grown to a height of at least five
feet.</p>

<p>The most interesting feature of this elaborately illustrated title-page
is the representation of the &ldquo;Vegetable Lamb&rdquo; growing on a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>144]</a></span>
stalk and browsing on the herbage round about it.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> This records
one of the most curious myths of the Middle Ages. The creature was
also known as the Scythian Lamb and the Borametz or Barometz,
a name derived from a Tartar word signifying &ldquo;lamb.&rdquo; It was
supposed to be at once a true animal and a living plant, and was
said to grow in the territory of the &ldquo;Tartars of the East,&rdquo; formerly
called Scythia. According to some writers, the lamb was the
fruit of a tree, whose fruit or seed-pod, when fully ripe, burst
open and disclosed a little lamb perfect in every way. This was
the subject of the illustration, &ldquo;The Vegetable Lamb plant,&rdquo;
in Sir John Mandeville&rsquo;s book. Other writers described the lamb
as being supported above the ground by a stalk flexible enough
to allow the animal to feed on the herbage growing near. When
it had consumed all within its reach the stem withered and the
lamb died. This is the version illustrated on Parkinson&rsquo;s title-page.
It was further reported that the lamb was a favourite
food of wolves, but that no other carnivorous animals would
attack it. This remarkable legend obtained credence for at
least 400 years. So far as is known, the first mention of it in an
English book is the account given by Sir John Mandeville, &ldquo;the
Knyght of Ingelond that was y bore in the toun of Seynt Albans,
and travelide aboute in the worlde in many diverse countries to
se mervailes and customes of countreis and diversiters of folkys
and diverse shap of men and of beistis.&rdquo; It is in the chapter
describing the curiosities he met with in the dominions of the
&ldquo;Cham&rdquo; of Tartary that the passage about the vegetable lamb
occurs.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> The origin of this extraordinary myth is undoubtedly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>145]</a></span>
to be found in the ancient descriptions of the cotton plant by
Herodotus, Ctesias, Strabo, Pliny and others.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> The following
passages in Herodotus and Pliny will suffice to show how easily
the myth may have grown. &ldquo;Certain trees bear for their fruit
fleeces surpassing those of sheep in beauty and excellence&rdquo;
(Herodotus). &ldquo;These trees bear gourds the size of a quince which
burst when ripe and display balls of wool out of which the
inhabitants make cloths like valuable linen&rdquo; (Pliny).</p>

<p class="captonly">TITLE-PAGE OF PARKINSON&rsquo;S &ldquo;PARADISUS&rdquo; (1629)</p>

<p>In his <i>Theatrum Botanicum</i> Parkinson describes the &ldquo;Scythian
Lamb,&rdquo; and one gathers that he accepted the travellers&rsquo; tales
about it. &ldquo;This strange living plant as it is reported by divers
good authors groweth among the Tartares about Samarkand and
the parts thereabouts rising from a seede somewhat bigger and
rounder than a Melon seede with a stalk about five palmes high
without any leafe thereon but onely bearing a certaine fruit and
the toppe in forme resembling a small lambe, whose coate or
rinde is woolly like unto a Lambe&rsquo;s skinne, the pulp or meat
underneath, which is like the flesh of a Lobster, having it is
sayed blood also in it; it hath the forme of an head hanging down
and feeding on the grasse round about it untill it hath consumed
it and then dyeth or else will perish if the grasse round about it
bee cut away of purpose. It hath foure legges also hanging downe.
The wolves much affect to feed on them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The preface to the <i>Paradisus</i> is singularly beautiful, being
typical of the simple, devout-minded author, but it is too long to
quote. The book itself is truly &ldquo;a speaking garden,&rdquo; a tranquil,
spacious Elizabethan garden, full of the loveliness, colour and
scent of damask, musk and many other roses; of lilies innumerable&mdash;the
crown imperial, the gold and red lilies, the Persian lily
(&ldquo;brought unto Constantinople and from thence sent unto us
by Mr. Nicholas Lete, a worthy Merchant and a lover of all faire
flowers&rdquo;), the blush Martagon, the bright red Martagon of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>146]</a></span>
Hungary and the lesser mountain lily. Of fritillaries of every
sort&mdash;of which Parkinson tells us that &ldquo;although divers learned
men do by the name given unto this delightful plant think it doth
in some things partake with a Tulipe or Daffodill; yet I, finding
it most like unto a little Lilly, have (as you see here) placed it
next unto the Lillies and before them.&rdquo; Of gay tulips, which
were amongst his special favourites&mdash;&ldquo;But indeed this flower,
above many other, deserveth his true commendations and
acceptance with all lovers of these beauties, both for the stately
aspect and for the admirable varietie of colour, that daily doe
arise in them,&rdquo;&mdash;and of which he had a collection such as would
be the glory of any garden&mdash;the tulip of Caffa, the greater red
Bolonia tulip, the tulip of Candie, the tulip of Armenia, the
Fool&rsquo;s Coat tulip, the Cloth of Silver tulip and others too numerous
to mention. (&ldquo;They are all now made denizens in our Gardens,&rdquo;
he joyously tells us, &ldquo;where they yield us more delight and more
increase for their proportion by reason of their culture, than they
did unto their owne naturals&rdquo;). Of daffodils, crocuses and
hyacinths in boundless profusion, amongst which are to be noted
many pleasing names that we no longer use. Of asphodels,
&ldquo;which doe grow naturally in Spaine and France and from thence
were first brought unto us to furnish our Gardens.&rdquo; Of many-coloured
flags, which he calls by the prettier name of &ldquo;flower de
luce,&rdquo; and amongst which he gives pride of place &ldquo;for his
excellent beautie and raretie to the great Turkie Flower de luce.&rdquo;
Of gladioli, cyclamen and anemones. Of the last-named he
writes thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Anemones likewise or Windeflowers are so full of variety
and so dainty so pleasant and so delightsome flowers that the
sight of them doth enforce an earnest longing desire in the mind
of anyone to be a possessoure of some of them at the leaste. For
without all doubt this one kind of flower, so variable in colours,
so differing in form (being almost as many sortes of them double
as single), so plentifull in bearing flowers and so durable in lasting
and also so easie both to preserve and to encrease is of itselfe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>147]</a></span>
alone almost sufficient to furnish a garden with flowers for almost
half the yeare. But to describe the infinite (as I may so say)
variety of the colours of the flowers and to give each his true
distinction and denomination it passeth my ability I confesse,
and I thinke would grauell the best experienced in Europe.&rdquo;
(Nevertheless he writes of about fifty varieties.) Of fragrant
crane&rsquo;s-bills, bear&rsquo;s-ears, primroses and cowslips. Of violets,
borage, marigolds, campions, snapdragons, columbines and
lark&rsquo;s-heels (delphiniums). Of gillyflowers (why have we given
up this old-fashioned English name?), and how pleasant is the
mere reading of his list of varieties&mdash;&ldquo;Master Bradshawe his
daintie Ladie,&rdquo; &ldquo;Ruffling Robin,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Fragrant,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Red
Hulo,&rdquo; &ldquo;John Witte his great tawny gillow flower,&rdquo; &ldquo;Lustie
Gallant,&rdquo; &ldquo;The fair maid of Kent,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Speckled Tawny.&rdquo;
&ldquo;But the most beautiful that ever I did see was with Master
Ralph Tuggie,<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> the which gilliflower I must needes therefore call
&lsquo;Master Tuggies Princesse,&rsquo; which is the greatest and fairest of all
these sorts of variable tawnies, being as large fully as the Prince
or Chrystall, or something greater, standing comely and round,
not loose or shaken, or breaking the pod as some other sorts will;
the marking of the flower is in this manner: It is of a stamell
colour, striped and marbled with white stripes and veines quite
through every leafe, which are as deeply iagged as the Hulo:
sometimes it hath more red then white, and sometimes more
white then red, and sometimes so equally marked that you cannot
discern which hath the mastery; yet which of these hath the
predominance, still the flower is very beautifull and exceeding
delightsome.&rdquo; Of peonies, lupins, pinks, sea-holly and sweet-william.
Of lilies of the valley, gentian, Canterbury bells,
hollyhocks and mallows (&ldquo;which for their bravery are entertained
everywhere unto every countrey-woman&rsquo;s garden&rdquo;). Of foxgloves,
goldilocks, valerian and mullein. Of cuckoo-flowers,
&ldquo;or Ladies smockes,&rdquo; both the double and the trefoil. The first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>148]</a></span>
kind, Parkinson tells us, &ldquo;is found in divers places of our owne
Countrey as neere Micham about eight miles from London;&rdquo;
also in Lancashire, &ldquo;from whence I received a plant, which
perished, but was found by the industrie of a worthy Gentlewoman
dwelling in those parts called Mistresse Thomasin Tunstall,
a great lover of these delights. The other was sent me by my
especiall good friend John Tradescant, who brought it among
other dainty plants from beyond the seas, and imparted thereof
a root to me.&rdquo; Of clematis and candytufts, honeysuckles and
jasmine. Of double-flowered cherries, apples and peaches.
&ldquo;The beautiful shew of these three sorts of flowers,&rdquo; he says,
&ldquo;hath made me to insert them into this garden, in that for their
worthinesse I am unwilling to bee without them, although the
rest of their kindes I have transferred into the Orchard, where
among other fruit trees they shall be remembered: for all these
here set downe seldome or never beare any fruite, and therefore
more fit for a Garden of flowers then an Orchard of fruite. These
trees be very fit to be set by Arbours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In this garden of pleasant flowers we find also many fragrant
herbs. &ldquo;After all these faire and sweete flowers,&rdquo; says Parkinson,
&ldquo;I must adde a few sweete herbes, both to accomplish
this Garden, and to please your senses, by placing them in your
Nosegayes, or elsewhere as you list. And although I bring them
in the end or last place, yet they are not of the least account.&rdquo;
He writes first of rosemary, the common, the gilded, the broad-leaved
and the double-flowered. Of rosemary he tells us:
&ldquo;This common Rosemary is so well knowne through all our
Land, being in every woman&rsquo;s garden, that it were sufficient
but to name it as an ornament among other sweete herbes and
flowers in our Garden. It is well observed, as well in this our
Land (where it hath been planted in Noblemen&rsquo;s, and great
men&rsquo;s gardens against brick wals, and there continued long)
as beyond the Seas, in the naturall places where it groweth,
that it riseth up in time unto a very great height, with a great
and woody stemme (of that compasse that&mdash;being clouen out
into thin boards&mdash;it hath served to make lutes, or such like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>149]</a></span>
instruments, and here with us Carpenters rules, and to divers
other purposes), branching out into divers and sundry armes
that extend a great way, and from them againe into many other
smaller branches, whereon we see at several distances, at the
ioynts, many very narrow long leaves, greene above, and whitish
underneath, among which come forth towards the toppes of the
stalkes, divers sweet gaping flowers of a pale or bleake blewish
colour, many set together standing in whitish huskes ...
although it will spring of the seede reasonable well, yet it is so
small and tender the first yeare, that a sharpe winter killeth it
quickly, unlesse it be very well defended; the whole plant as
well leaves as flowers, smelleth exceeding sweete.&rdquo; Of sage
and of lavender both the purple and the rare white<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> (&ldquo;there is
a kinde hereof that beareth white flowers and somewhat broader
leaves, but it is very rare and seene but in few places with us,
because it is more tender, and will not so well endure our cold
Winters&rdquo;). &ldquo;Lavender,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;is almost wholly spent with
us, for to perfume linnen, apparell, gloues and leather and the
dryed flowers to comfort and dry up the moisture of a cold
braine.&rdquo; Of French lavender (&ldquo;the whole plant is somewhat
sweete, but nothing so much as Lavender). It groweth in the
Islands Staechades which are over against Marselles and in
Arabia also: we keep it with great care in our Gardens. It
flowreth the next yeare after it is sowne, in the end of May,
which is a moneth before any Lavender.&rdquo; Of lavender cotton,
of which he writes: &ldquo;the whole plant is of a strong sweete
sent, but not unpleasant, and is planted in Gardens to border
knots with, for which it will abide to be cut into what forme you
think best, for it groweth thicke and bushy, very fit for such
workes, besides the comely shew the plant it selfe thus wrought
doth yeeld, being alwayes greene and of a sweet sent.&rdquo; Of
basil, &ldquo;wholly spent to make sweet or washing waters, among
other sweet herbes, yet sometimes it is put into nosegayes. The
Physicall properties are to procure a cheerfull and merry heart&rdquo;;
and marjoram, &ldquo;not onely much used to please the outward
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>150]</a></span>
senses in nosegayes and in the windowes of houses, as also in
sweete pouders, sweete bags, and sweete washing waters.&rdquo; Of
all the varieties of thyme and hyssop&mdash;and of the white hyssop
he writes that its striped leaves &ldquo;make it delightfull to most
Gentlewomen.&rdquo; Hyssop, he tells us further, &ldquo;is used of many
people in the Country to be laid unto cuts or fresh wounds,
being bruised, and applyed eyther alone, or with a little sugar.&rdquo;
&ldquo;And thus,&rdquo; he concludes this part of the book, &ldquo;have I led
you through all my Garden of Pleasure, and shewed you all
the varieties of nature housed therein, pointing unto them and
describing them one after another. And now lastly (according
to the use of our old ancient Fathers) I bring you to rest on the
Grasse, which yet shall not be without some delight, and that
not the least of all the rest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From his garden of pleasant flowers he leads us to the kitchen
garden, full not only of &ldquo;vegetables&rdquo; as we understand the
term, of strawberries, cucumbers and pompions, but also of a
vast number of herbs in daily use, many of them never seen in
modern gardens. Besides the familiar thyme, balm, savory,
mint, marjoram, and parsley, there are clary, costmary, pennyroyal,
fennel, borage, bugloss, tansy, burnet, blessed thistle,
marigolds, arrach, rue, patience, angelica, chives, sorrel, smallage,
bloodwort, dill, chervil, succory, purslane, tarragon, rocket,
mustard, skirrets, rampion, liquorice and caraway. But
according to Parkinson they used fewer herbs in his day than
in olden times; for under pennyroyal we find, &ldquo;The former age
of our great-grandfathers had all these pot herbes in much and
familiar use, both for their meates and medicines, and therewith
preserved themselves in long life and much health: but
this delicate age of ours, which is not pleased with anything
almost, be it meat or medicine, that is not pleasant to the palate,
doth wholly refuse these almost, and therefore cannot be partaker
of the benefit of them.&rdquo; From the kitchen garden with
all these herbs, &ldquo;of most necessary uses for the Country Gentlewomen&rsquo;s
houses,&rdquo; he leads us, finally, to the orchard, with its
endless varieties of apple and pear trees, of cherries, medlars,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>151]</a></span>
plums, &ldquo;apricockes&rdquo; and nectarines, of figs and peaches and
almonds, of quinces, walnuts, mulberries and vines (ending with
the Virginian vine, of which he says, &ldquo;we know of no use but
to furnish a Garden and to encrease the number of rarities&rdquo;),
until, like the Queen of Sheba, we feel that, with all we have heard
of the comfortable splendour of Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign, the half has
not been told us. &ldquo;And thus,&rdquo; Parkinson concludes, &ldquo;have I
finished this worke, and furnished it with whatsoever Art and
Nature concurring could effect to bring delight to those that
live in our Climate and take pleasure in such things; which
how well or ill done, I must abide every one&rsquo;s censure; the
iudicious and courteous I onely respect, let Momus bite his lips
and eate his heart; and so Farewell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Parkinson&rsquo;s monumental work, <i>Theatrum Botanicum</i>, was
completed, as already mentioned, in his seventy-third year.
In it about 3800 plants are described (nearly double the number
of those in the first edition of Gerard&rsquo;s Herbal). In the <i>Theatrum</i>
he incorporated nearly the whole of Bauhin&rsquo;s <i>Pinax</i>, besides
part of the unfinished work by de l&rsquo;Obel mentioned before. The
book remained the most complete English treatise on plants
until the time of Ray. Parkinson originally intended to entitle
it &ldquo;A Garden of Simples&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> and, had he done so, it is at least
possible that this work, to which he devoted the greater part
of his life, would have achieved the popularity it deserved.
Except in the illustrations, it is a finer book than Gerard&rsquo;s, but
the latter remained the more popular. In fact, this herbal of
Parkinson&rsquo;s is an outstanding proof that a good book may be
ruined by a bad title. <i>Theatrum Botanicum</i> sounds hard and
chilling, whereas <i>Gerard&rsquo;s Herball</i> has an attractive ring. The
fact that the former never attained the popularity achieved by
the latter seems the more pathetic when we read the author&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>152]</a></span>
own concluding charge to this work of his lifetime:&mdash;&ldquo;Goe
forth now therefore thou issue artificial of mine and supply
the defect of a Naturall, to beare up thy Father&rsquo;s name and
memory to succeeding ages and what in thee lyeth effect more
good to thy Prince and Country then numerous of others, which
often prove rather plagues then profits thereto, and feare not
the face of thy fiercest foe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The ornamental title-page of the <i>Theatrum Botanicum</i> is both
interesting and impressive. The two most important figures
are those of Adam and Solomon (representing Toil and Wisdom
respectively). Solomon is dressed in a long coat with an ermine
cape, and he wears Roman sandals. At the four corners of the
page are female figures:&mdash;Europe driving majestically in a
chariot with a pair of horses; Asia clad in short skirts and shoes
with curled points and riding a rhinoceros; Africa wearing only
a hat, and mounted upon a zebra; and America, also unclothed,
carrying a bow and arrow and riding a sheep with surprisingly
long ears. Each of these figures is surrounded by specimens
of the vegetation of their respective continents.</p>

<p>It is curious to find in the dedicatory letter to Charles I.
a touch of the old belief that diseases are due to evil spirits:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;And I doubt not of your Majesties further care of their
bodies health that such Workes as deliver approved Remedyes
may be divulged whereby they may both cure and prevent
their diseases. Most properly therefore doth this Worke belong
to your Majesty&rsquo;s patronage both to further and defend that
malevolent spirits should not dare to cast forth their venome
or aspertions to the prejudice of any well-deserving, but that
thereby under God and Good direction, all may live in health
as well as wealth, peace and godliness, which God grant and
that this boldnesse may be pardoned to</p>

There are letters extolling the Herbal from three Oxford
doctors, two of whom refer to the then newly-made physic
garden on the Cherwell. One writes thus: &ldquo;Oxford and England
are happy in the foundation of a spacious illustrious
physicke garden, compleately beautifully walled and gated,
now in levelling and planting with the charges and expences of
thousands by the many wayes Honourable Earle of Danby,
the furnishing and enriching whereof and of many a glorious
Tempe, with all usefull and delightfull plants will be the better
expedited by your painefull happy satisfying Worke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tho. Clayton, His Majesty&rsquo;s prof. of Physicke, Oxon.&rdquo;</p>


<p class="hrpad">One who signs himself &ldquo;Your affectionate friend John Bainbridge
Doctor of Physique, and Professor of Astronomy, Oxon&rdquo;
writes thus: &ldquo;I am a stranger to your selfe but not to your
learned and elaborate volumnes. I have with delight and
admiration surveyed your <i>Theatrum Botanicum</i>, a stately
Fabrique, collected and composed with excessive paines....
It is a curious pourtrait and description of th&rsquo; Earths flowred
mantle, the Herbarist&rsquo;s Oracle, a rich Magazin of soveraigne
Medicines, physicall experiments and other rarities.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Parkinson divides his plants into &ldquo;Classes or Tribes&rdquo;:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>1. Sweete smelling Plants.<br />
2. Purging Plants.<br />
3. Venemous Sleepy and Hurtfull plants and their Counter poysons.<br />

</div>

<p>Under &ldquo;The Unordered Tribe&rdquo; we find the na&iuml;ve remark:
&ldquo;In this tribe as in a gathering campe I must take up all those
straglers that have either lost their rankes or were not placed
in some of the foregoing orders that so I may preserve them from
losse and apply them to some convenient service for the worke&rdquo;!</p>

<p>It is surprising how much folk lore survives even in Parkinson&rsquo;s
Herbal. Like Gerard, he pours scorn on a good many
contemporary beliefs, but many he accepts unquestioningly,
especially those concerning the use of herbs as amulets and also
for the promotion of happiness. He gives also some old gardening
beliefs not to be found in other herbals, but very common
in contemporary books on gardening and husbandry, and more
bee lore than most herbals contain. Nearly all the old herbalists
believed in the value of growing balm near the beehives, and
also of rubbing the hive with this herb, but Parkinson alone
tells us of the harmful effects of woad:<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> &ldquo;Some have sowen
it but they have founde it to be the cause of the Destruction
of their Bees, for it hath been observed that they have dyed as
it were of a Flix that have tasted hereof.&rdquo; Of balm,<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> however,
he writes: &ldquo;it is an hearbe wherein Bees do much delight
both to have their Hives rubbed therewith to keepe them
together and draw others and for them to suck and feed upon.&rdquo;
Elsewhere he tells us that &ldquo;it hath been observed that bees
will hardly thrive well where many Elmes doe grow or at least
if they upon their first going forth abroad after Winter doe
light on the bloomings or seed thereof.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> Of the sweet-smelling
flag he says: &ldquo;it is verily believed of many that the leaves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>155]</a></span>
or roots of Acorus tyed to a hive of Bees stayeth them from
wandering or flying away and draweth a greater resort of others
thereto.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<p>Upon the use of herbs as amulets his views seem inconsistent.
He is scornful of the custom of hanging a piece of
mistletoe to children&rsquo;s necks &ldquo;against witchcraft and the illusion
of Sathan&rdquo;; yet he gravely informs us that &ldquo;if the sope that
is made of the lye of the ashes [of glassewort] be spread upon
a piece of thicke course brown paper cut into the forme of
their shooe sole, that are casually taken speechless and bound to
the soles of their feete it will bring again the speech and that
within a little time after the applying thereof if there be any
hope of being restored while they live: this hath been tried
to be effectuall upon diverse persons.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> The custom of wearing
meadowsweet or hanging it up in living-rooms<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> he describes as a
&ldquo;superstitious conceit,&rdquo; but he accepts without demur the
tradition<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> that a wreath of periwinkle &ldquo;worne about the legs
defendeth them that wear it from the crampe.&rdquo; Bartholom&aelig;us
Anglicus tells us that Augustus C&aelig;sar used to wear a wreath of
bryony during a thunderstorm to protect himself from lightning,
but the story is not repeated until, after the lapse of
four hundred years, we find in Parkinson the statement that
&ldquo;Augustus C&aelig;sar was wont to weare bryony with bayes made
into a roule or garlande thereby to be secured from lightening.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>
Parkinson regards the use of herbs against witchcraft as sheer
foolishness, but he is the only herbalist who gives us a potion<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>
which &ldquo;resisteth such charmes or the like witchery that is
used in such drinkes that are given to produce love.&rdquo; Like
Gerard, he does not question the efficacy of borage, bugloss and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>156]</a></span>
many other herbs to promote happiness. Of borage<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> he tells
us: &ldquo;The leaves floures and seedes are very cordiall and helpe
to expell pensivenesse and melancholie that ariseth without
manifest cause&rdquo;; and of a confection made from oak galls,<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>
that it is &ldquo;dayly commended and used with good effect against

rootes or seedes are effectuall to comfort the heart and to expell
sadnesse and causelesse melancholy.&rdquo; In common with other
herbalists he believed also that herbs could be used to strengthen
the memory, to help weak brains, to quicken the senses and even
to soothe &ldquo;frenzied&rdquo; people. Of eyebright,<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> used for so many
centuries, and even until recent times, to help dull sight, he
says: &ldquo;it helpeth a weake braine or memory and restoreth
them being decayed in a short time.&rdquo; Fleabane &ldquo;bound to
the forehead is a great helpe to cure one of the frensie,&rdquo;
while &ldquo;the distilled water of thyme applyed with vinegar of
Roses to the forehead easeth the rage of Frensye.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> Lavender
is of &ldquo;especiall good use for all griefes and paines of the head
and brain,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> and sage<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> is of &ldquo;excellent good use to helpe the
memory by warming and quickening the senses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Parkinson gives more beauty recipes than any other
herbalist. For those who wish to darken their hair he recommends
washing it with a decoction of bramble leaves.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> The
golden flowers of mullein<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> &ldquo;boyled in lye dyeth the haires of

ashes of southernwood<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> mixed with old salad oil will cause a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>157]</a></span>
beard to grow or hair on a bald head, and yarrow is almost
as good; garden spurge, elder flowers, broom, madder, rue,
gentian, scabious, betony, elecampane, Solomon&rsquo;s Seal, the
great hawkweed and lupin are all excellent to &ldquo;cleanse the
skinne from freckles, sunburn and wrinkles.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> The French
women &ldquo;account the distilled water of pimpernell mervailous
good to clense the skinne from any roughnesse deformity or
discolouring thereof and to make it smooth neate and cleere.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>
The Italian dames, however, &ldquo;doe much use the distilled water
of the whole plant of Solomon&rsquo;s Seal.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> Lupin seems to have
the most remarkable virtue, for not only will it take away all
smallpox marks, but it will also make the user &ldquo;look more
amiable&rdquo;! Many women, therefore, &ldquo;doe use the meale of
Lupines mingled with the gall of a goate and some juyce of
Lemons to make into a forme of a soft ointment.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> Parkinson
is the only herbalist who gives recipes to enable people to get
thin and also to look pale. &ldquo;The powder of the seedes of elder<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>
first prepared in vinegar and then taken in wine halfe a dramme
at a time for certaine dayes together is a meane to abate and
consume the fat flesh of a corpulent body and to keepe it leane.&rdquo;
For those who like to look pale he recommends cumin seed
and bishopsweed.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> And &ldquo;for a sweet powder<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> to lay among
linnen and garments and to make sweet waters to wash hand-gloves
or other things to perfume them&rdquo; he recommends the
roots of the sweet-smelling flag.</p>

<p>It is, however, the curious out-of-the-way pieces of information
on all sorts of matters which are so interesting in Parkinson&rsquo;s
Herbal. He tells us that three several sorts of colours
are made from the berries of the purging thorn; that the yellow
dye is used by painters, &ldquo;and also by Bookbinders to colour
the edges of Bookes and by leather dressers to colour leather&rdquo;;
that the green dye is &ldquo;usually put up into great bladders tyed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>158]</a></span>
with strong thred at the head and hung up untill it is drye,
which is dissolved in water or wine, but sacke is the best to
preserve the colour from &lsquo;starving,&rsquo; as they call it, that is
from decaying, and to make it hold fresh the longer&rdquo;; and that
the purple dye is made by leaving the berries on the bushes
until the end of November, when they are ready to drop off.
That the best mushrooms grow under oaks or fir trees. That
spurry leaves bruised and laid to a cut finger will speedily heal
it, &ldquo;whereof the Country people in divers places say they have
had good experience,&rdquo; and that it is also good for causing
&ldquo;the Kine to give more store of milke than ordinary otherwise,
so it causeth Pullaine likewise to lay more store of egges.&rdquo;
That the fruit of the bead tree &ldquo;being drilled and drawne on
stringes serves people beyond sea to number their prayers
thereon least they forget themselves and give God too many.&rdquo;
That in Warwickshire the female fern was always used &ldquo;in
steed of Sope to wash their clothes,&rdquo; and that it was gathered
about Midsummer, &ldquo;unto good big balls which when they will
use them they burne them in the fire until it becomes blewish,
which being then layd by will dissolve into powder of itselfe,
like unto Lime: foure of these balles being dissolved in warme
water is sufficient to wash a whole bucke full of clothes.&rdquo; That
the burning of lupin seeds drives away gnats, and that half-sodden
barley &ldquo;given to Hennes that hardly or seldome lay
egges will cause them to lay both greater and more often.&rdquo;
That country housewives use that common weed horsetail to
scour their wooden, pewter and brass vessels, and sometimes boil
the young tops of the same weed and eat them like asparagus.
That bramble leaves do not fall until all the sharp frosts are
over, &ldquo;whereby the country men do observe that the extremity
of Winter is past when they fall off.&rdquo; That every year sacks
full of violets are sent from Marseilles to Alexandria and other
parts of Egypt, &ldquo;where they use them boyled in water which
only by their religion they are enjoined to drinke.&rdquo; That if
you suspect your wine is watered &ldquo;you shall put some thereof
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>159]</a></span>
into a cup that is made of ivie wood and if there be any water
therein it will remaine in the cup and the wine will soak through,
for the nature of Ivie is not to hold any wine so great an antipathy
there is between them.&rdquo; That skilful shepherds are
careful not to let their flocks feed in pastures where mouseare
abounds, &ldquo;lest they grow sicke and leane and die quickly after.&rdquo;
That writing-ink can be made of the green fruit of alder trees.
That the bark of the same tree is useful for making &ldquo;a blacke
dye for the courser sorts of things,&rdquo; and that the leaves put
under the bare feet of travellers are &ldquo;a great refreshing unto
them.&rdquo; That the rose of Jericho opened the night our Saviour
was born, and that placed in any house it will open when a child
is born. That mouseare if given to any horse &ldquo;will cause that
he shall not be hurt by the Smith that shooeth him.&rdquo; That
purslane is not only a sovereign remedy for crick in the neck,
but also for &ldquo;blastings by lightening, or planets and for burnings
by Gunpowder or otherwise.&rdquo; That country folk in Kent
and Sussex call sopewort &ldquo;Gill-run-by-the-streete.&rdquo; That
agrimony leaves will cure cattle suffering from coughs, and that
wounded deer use this same herb to heal their hurts. That a
decoction made of hemp will draw earthworms out of their
holes and that fishermen thus obtain their bait. That crops of
woad may be cut three times in the year, and that dyers&rsquo; weed
will change to green any cloth or silk first dyed blue with woad,
&ldquo;and for these uses there is great store of this herbe spent in
all countries and thereof many fields are sowen for the purpose.&rdquo;
That country-folk use goose-grass as a strainer &ldquo;to clear their
milke from strawes, haires, and any other thing that falleth into
it.&rdquo; That St. John&rsquo;s wort is used by country-folk to drive
away devils. That &ldquo;Clownes woundwort&rdquo; owes its name to
a labourer who healed himself therewith of a cut with a scythe
in his leg. That willow-herb, being burned, &ldquo;driveth away
flies and gnats and other such like small creatures which use
in diverse places that are neere to Fennes, marsh or water
sides to infest them that dwell there in the night season to sting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>160]</a></span>
and bite them, leaving the marks and spots thereof in their faces
which beside the deformity, which is but for a while, leaveth
them that are thus bitten not without paine for a time.&rdquo; That
from turnesole (heliotropium) are made &ldquo;those ragges of cloth
which are usually called Turnesole in the Druggists and Grocers
shoppes and with all other people and serveth to colour jellies or
other things as every one please.&rdquo; That when French ladies
coloured their faces with an ointment containing anchusa the
colour did not last long. That no &ldquo;good gentlewoman in the land
that would do good&rdquo; should be without a store of bugloss ointment
either for her own family &ldquo;or other her poor neighbours
that want helpe and means to procure it,&rdquo; and that beyond
the sea in France and Germany it is a common proverb &ldquo;that
they neede neither Physition to cure their inward diseases nor
Chirurgion to helpe them of any wound or sore that have this
Bugle and Sanicle at hand by them to use.&rdquo; That this is
equally true of the herb self-heale. That country-folk use sanicle
to anoint their hands &ldquo;when they are chapt by the winde.&rdquo;
That goat&rsquo;s rue is good for fattening hens. That Herbe True
love taken every day for twenty days will help those &ldquo;that by
witchcraft (as it is thought) have become half foolish to become
perfectly restored to their former good estate.&rdquo; That the best
starch is made from the root of cuckoo-pint, and that in former
dayes when the making of our ordinary starch &ldquo;was not knowen
or frequent in use; the finest Dames used the rootes hereof to
starch their linnen, which would so sting, exasperate and choppe
the skinne of their servants&rsquo; hands that used it, that they could
scarce get them smooth and whole with all the nointing they
could doe before they should use it againe.&rdquo; That the root
of this same herb, cut small and mixed with a sallet of white
endive or lettice, is &ldquo;an excellent dish to entertain a smell-feast
or unbidden unwelcome guest to a man&rsquo;s table, to make
sport with him and drive him from his too much boldnesse;
or the pouder of the dried roote strawed upon any daintie bit
of meate that may be given him to eate; for either way within
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>161]</a></span>
a while after the taking of it, it will so burne and pricke his
mouthe that he shall not be able either to eate a bit more or
scarce to speak for paine and so will abide untill there be some
new milk or fresh butter given, which by little and little will
take away the heate and pricking and restore him againe.&rdquo;
That another &ldquo;good jest for a bold unwelcome guest&rdquo; is to
infuse nightshade in a little wine for six or seven hours and
serve it to the guest, who then &ldquo;shall not be able to eat any
meate for that meale nor untill he drinks some vinegar which
will presently dispell that qualitie and cause him to fall to his
viands with as good a stomach as he had before.&rdquo; That
sufferers from toothache should rub the bruised root of crowfoote
on to their fingers; by causing &ldquo;more paine therein than is felt
by the toothach it taketh away the pain.&rdquo; That the juice of
fumitory, if dropped in the eyes, will take away the redness and
other defects, &ldquo;although it procure some paine for the present
and bringeth forth teares.&rdquo; That the hunters and shepherds of
Austria commend the roots of the supposed wolf&rsquo;s-bane &ldquo;against
the swimming or turning in the head which is a disease subject
to those places rising from the feare and horroure of such steepe
downfalls and dangerous places which they doe and must continually
passe.&rdquo; That scabious, if bruised and applied &ldquo;to any
place wherein any splinter, broken bone, or any such like thing
lyeth in the flesh doth in short time loosen it and causeth it to
be easily drawen forth.&rdquo; That butcher&rsquo;s broom was used in
olden times to preserve &ldquo;hanged meate&rdquo; from being eaten by
mice and also for the making of brooms, &ldquo;but the King&rsquo;s
Chamber is by revolution of time turned to the Butcher&rsquo;s stall,
for that a bundle of the stalkes tied together serveth them to
cleanse their stalls and from thence have we our English name
of Butcher&rsquo;s broom.&rdquo; That the down of swallow-wort &ldquo;doth
make a farre softer stuffing for cushions or pillowes or the like
than Thistle downe which is much used in some places for the
like purpose.&rdquo; That, if ivory is boiled with mandrake root for
six hours, the ivory will become so soft &ldquo;that it will take what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>162]</a></span>
form or impression you will give it.&rdquo; That fresh elder flowers,
hung in a vessel of new wine and pressed every evening for
seven nights together, &ldquo;giveth to the wine a very good relish
and a smell like Muscadine.&rdquo; That the moth mullein is of no
use except that it will attract moths wherever it is laid. That
if pennyroyal is put into &ldquo;unwholesome and stinking waters
that men must drinke (as at sea in long voyages) it maketh them
the less hurtful.&rdquo; And to conclude, it is from Parkinson we
learn that &ldquo;Queen Elizabeth of famous memorie did more desire
medowsweet then any other sweete herbe to strewe her chambers
withall.&rdquo;</p>

Both John Tradescant and his son were gardeners to Charles I. and
Henrietta Maria. John Tradescant the elder is said by Anthony &agrave; Wood
to have been a Fleming or a Dutchman, but this is doubtful. The name is
neither Flemish nor Dutch but probably English, and in the inscription on
his tomb in Lambeth Churchyard he and his son are described as &ldquo;both
gardeners to the rose and lily queen.&rdquo; This was Henrietta Maria. Parkinson
in his <i>Paradisus</i> speaks of him as &ldquo;that painfull industrious searcher and
lover of all nature&rsquo;s varieties.&rdquo; Tradescant accompanied Sir Dudley Digges
on his voyage round the North Cape to Archangel, and on his return wrote
an account of the plants he had found in Russia&mdash;the earliest extant record
of plants in that part. It is interesting to note that in this he compares the
soil of Russia to that of Norfolk. In 1620 Tradescant joined an expedition
against the Algerine corsairs as a gentleman volunteer, and he also accompanied
the Duke of Buckingham (George Villiers), to whom he had formerly
been gardener, on the ill-fated expedition to La Rochelle. On Buckingham&rsquo;s
death he entered the royal service, and probably at this time established his
well-known physic garden and museum at Lambeth. The house was called
Tradescant&rsquo;s ark. There are three unsigned and undated portraits of the
elder Tradescant in the Ashmolean Collection at Oxford.</p>

<h2><a name="chap07" id="chap07"></a>CHAPTER VII<br />
<br />
<span class="smlfont">THE LATER SEVENTEENTH-CENTURY HERBALS</span></h2>

<div class="chaptop">
<p>&ldquo;Come into the fields then, and as you come along the streets, cast your
eyes upon the weeds as you call them that grow by the walls and under the
hedge-sides.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">W. Coles</span>, <i>The Art of Simpling</i>, 1656.</p>
</div>


<p>The later seventeenth-century herbals are marked by a
return to the belief in the influence upon herbs of the heavenly
bodies, but it is a travesty rather than a reflection of the ancient
astrological lore. The most notable exponent of this debased
lore was the infamous Nicholas Culpeper, in whom, nevertheless,
the poor people in the East End seem to have had a boundless
faith. It is impossible to look at the portrait of that light-hearted
rogue without realising that there must have been
something extraordinarily attractive about the man who was
the last to set up publicly as an astrologer and herb doctor.
He was the son of a clergyman who had a living somewhere in
Surrey. After a brief time at Cambridge he was apprenticed
to an apothecary near St. Helen&rsquo;s, Bishopsgate, and shortly
afterwards set up for himself in Red Lion Street, Spitalfields,
as an astrologer and herbalist. Culpeper was a staunch
Roundhead and fought in at least one battle. All through the
war, however, he continued his practice and he acquired a great
popularity in the East End of London. In 1649 he issued his
<i>Physical Directory</i>, which was a translation of the <i>London Dispensatory</i>.
This drew down on him the fury of the College of
Physicians, and the book was virulently attacked in a broadside
issued in 1652, entitled &ldquo;A farm in Spittlefields where all the
knick-knacks of astrology are exposed to open sale.&rdquo; By this
time his works were enjoying an enormous sale. No fewer
than five editions of his <i>English Physician Enlarged</i> appeared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>164]</a></span>
before 1698, and it was reissued even as late as 1802 and again
in 1809. There is a vivid description of Culpeper in <i>The
Gentleman&rsquo;s Magazine</i> for May 1797:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;He was of a middle stature, of a spare lean body, dark
complexion, brown hair, rather long visage, piercing quick
eyes, very active and nimble. Though of an excellent wit,
sharp fancy, admirable conception and of an active understanding,
yet occasionally inclined to melancholy, which was such an
extraordinary enemy to him that sometimes wanting company
he would seem like a dead man. He was very eloquent, a good
orator though very conceited and full of jest, which was so
inseparable to him that in his most serious writings, he would
mingle matters of levity and extremely please himself in so doing.
Though his family possessed considerable property it appears
he was exceedingly restricted in his pecuniary concerns, which
probably was the cause of his early leaving the University, as
he observes; though his mother lived till he was twenty-three
years of age and left him well provided, yet he was cheated or
nearly spent all his fortune in the outset of life. Another author
observes it is most true that he was always subject to a consumption
of the purse, notwithstanding the many ways he had to
assist him. His patrimony was also chiefly consumed at the
University. Indeed he had a spirit so far above the vulgar,
that he condemned and scorned riches any other way than to
make them serviceable to him. He was as free of his purse as
of his pen.... He acknowledged he had many pretended
friends, but he was rather prejudiced than bettered by them,
for, when he most stood in need of their friendship and assistance
they most of all deceived him.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Culpeper wrote a number of medical works which do not
concern us here, but his name will always be associated with
his Herbal. His reason for having written it he affirms to be
that, of the operation of herbs by the stars he found few authors
had written, &ldquo;and those as full of nonsense and contradiction
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>165]</a></span>
as an Egg is full of meat. This not being pleasing and less
profitable to me, I consulted with my two brothers Dr. Reason
and Dr. Experience and took a voyage to visit my Mother Nature,
by whose advice together with the help of Dr. Diligence I at
last obtained my desire and, being warned by Mr. Honesty (a
stranger in our days) to publish it to the world, I have done it.&rdquo;
It is impossible to read any part of this absurd book without
a vision arising of the old rogue standing at the street corner
and not only collecting but holding an interested crowd of the
common folk by the sort of arguments which they not only
understand but appreciate. In his preface he warns his readers
against the false copies of his book &ldquo;that are printed of that
letter the small Bibles are printed with ... there being twenty
or thirty gross errors in every sheet.&rdquo; He is withering in his
criticism of those who quote old authors as authorities. &ldquo;They
say Reason makes a man differ from a beast; if that be true,
pray what are they that instead of Reason for their judgment
quote old authors?&rdquo; In his preface, as throughout his book,
he affirms his belief in the connection between herbs and stars.
Diseases, he asserts, vary according to the motions of the stars,
&ldquo;and he that would know the reason for the operation of the
herbs must look up as high as the stars. It is essential to find
out what planet has caused the disease and then by what planet
the afflicted part of the body is governed. In the treatment
of the disease the influence of the planet must be opposed by
herbs under the influence of another planet, or in some cases by
sympathy, that is each planet curing its own disease.&rdquo; Elsewhere
he directs that plants must always be picked according
to the planet that is in the ascendant. Culpeper asserts that
herbs should be dried in the sun,<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> his ingenious reasoning being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>166]</a></span>
this:&mdash;&ldquo;For if the sun draw away the virtues of the herb it must
needs do the like by hay, which the experience of every farmer
will explode for a notable piece of nonsense.&rdquo; He also pours
scorn on those who say that the sap does not rise in the winter.
Here his argument is even more remarkable, and yet one cannot
help realising how effectual it would be with the class of folk
with whom he dealt. &ldquo;If the sap fall into the roots in the fall
of the leaf and lies there all the winter then must the root grow
all the winter, but the root grows not at all in the winter as
experience teaches, but only in the summer. If you set an apple
kernel in the spring you shall find the root to grow to a pretty
bigness in the summer and be not a whit bigger next spring.
What doth the sap do in the root all the winter that while?
Pick straws? &rsquo;Tis as rotten as a rotten post.&rdquo; He gives as
his own version of what happens to the sap that &ldquo;when the
sun declines from the tropic of cancer, the sap begins to congeal
both in root and branch. When he touches the tropic of capricorn
and ascends to uswards it begins to wax thin again.&rdquo;
One cannot help suspecting that Culpeper knew perfectly
well what nonsense he was talking, but that he also realised how
remunerative such nonsense was and how much his customers
were impressed by it. In his dissertation on wormwood one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>167]</a></span>
feels that he was writing with his tongue in his cheek, especially
in the conclusion, which is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;He that reads this and understands what he reads hath a
jewel of more worth than a diamond. He that understands it
not is as little fit to give physick. There lies a key in these
words, which will unlock (if it be turned by a wise hand) the
cabinet of physic. I have delivered it as plain as I durst ...
thus shall I live when I am dead. And thus I leave it to the
world, not caring a farthing whether they like it or dislike it.
The grave equals all men and therefore shall equal me with all
princes.... Then the ill tongue of a prating fellow or one
that hath more tongue than wit or more proud than honest
shall never trouble me. Wisdom is justified of her children.
And so much for wormwood.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="captonly">NICHOLAS CULPEPER FROM &ldquo;THE ENGLISH PHYSICIAN ENLARGED&rdquo;</p>

<p>Less popular than Culpeper&rsquo;s numerous writings, but far
more attractive and altogether of a different stamp, are Coles&rsquo;s
two books, <i>Adam in Eden</i> and <i>The Art of Simpling</i>. The title
of the latter runs thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;The Art of Simpling. An Introduction to the Knowledge
and Gathering of Plants. Wherein the Definitions, Divisions,
Places, Descriptions, Differences, Names, Vertues, Times of
flourishing and gathering, Uses, Temperatures, Signatures and
Appropriations of Plants are methodically laid down. London.
Printed by J.&nbsp;G. for Nath. Brook at the Angell in Cornhill. 1656.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>The preface is quaint and so typical of the spirit of the later
seventeenth-century herbals that I transcribe a good deal of it:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;What a rare happiness was it for Matthiolus that famous
Simpler, to live in those days wherein (as he himself reports)
so many Emperors, Kings, Arch-Dukes, Cardinalls and Bishops
did favour his Endeavour, and plentifully reward him! Whereas
in our times the Art of Simpling is so farre from being rewarded,
that it is grown contemptible and he is accounted a simple fellow,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>168]</a></span>
that pretends to have any skill therein. Truly it is to be lamented
that the men of these times which pretend to so much Light
should goe the way to put out their owne Eyes, by trampling
upon that which should preserve them, to the great discouragement
of those that have any mind to bend their Studies this
way. Notwithstanding, for the good of my Native Countrey,
which everyone is obliged to serve upon all occasions of advantage
and in pitty to such Mistakers, I have painfully endeavoured
plainly to demonstrate the way of attaining this necessary Art,
and the usefulnesse of it, in hopes that this Embryo thrown thus
into the wide world, will fall into the Lap of some worthy persons
that will cherish it, though I knew not any to whose protection
I might commend it. However I have adventured it abroad,
and to expresse my reall affection to the publick good have in it
communicated such Notions, as I have gathered, either from the
reading of Severall Authors, or by conferring sometimes with
Scholars, and sometimes with Countrey people; To which I
have added some Observations of mine Owne, never before published:
Most of which I am confident are true, and if there be
any that are not so, yet they are pleasant.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>There is something very attractive in the last inconsequent
remark!</p>

<p>Coles deals mercilessly with old Culpeper. &ldquo;Culpeper,&rdquo;
he says, &ldquo;(a man now dead and therefore I shall speak of him
as modestly as I can, for were he alive I should be more straight
with him), was a man very ignorant in the forme of Simples.
Many Books indeed he hath tumbled over, and transcribed
as much out of them as he thought would serve his turne (though
many times he were therein mistaken) but added very little of
his own.&rdquo; He even comments on the fact that either Culpeper
or his Printer cannot spell aright&mdash;&ldquo;sure he or the Printer had
not learned to spell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Doctrine of Signatures he accepts unquestioningly.
&ldquo;Though Sin and Sathan have plunged mankinde into an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>169]</a></span>
Ocean of Infirmities Yet the mercy of God which is over all his
Workes Maketh Grasse to grow upon the Mountaines and Herbs
for the use of Men and hath not onely stemped upon them (as
upon every man) a distinct forme, but also given them particular
signatures, whereby a Man may read even in legible Characters
the Use of them. Heart Trefoyle is so called not onely because
the Leafe is Triangular like the Heart of a Man, but also because
each leafe contains the perfect Icon of an Heart and that in its
proper colour viz a flesh colour. Hounds tongue hath a forme
not much different from its name which will tye the Tongues of
Hounds so that they shall not barke at you: if it be laid under
the bottomes of ones feet. Wallnuts bear the whole Signature
of the Head, the outwardmost green barke answerable to the
thick skin whereunto the head is covered, and a salt made of
it is singularly good for wounds in that part, as the Kernell is
good for the braines, which it resembles being environed with a
shell which imitates the Scull, and then it is wrapped up againe
in a silken covering somewhat representing the <i>Pia Mater</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of those plants that have no signatures he warns the reader
not to conclude hastily that therefore they have no use. &ldquo;We
must cast ourselves,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;with great Courage and Industry
(as some before us have done) upon attempting the vertues
of them, which are yet undiscovered. For man was not brought
into the world to live like an idle Loyterer or Truant, but to
exercise his minde in those things, which are therefore in some
measure obscure and intricate, yet not so much as otherwise
they would have been, it being easier to adde than invent at
first.&rdquo; He then gives his own curious but na&iuml;vely interesting
theory of plants &ldquo;commonly accounted useless and unprofitable.&rdquo;
&ldquo;They would not be without their use,&rdquo; he argues, &ldquo;if they
were good for nothing else but to exercise the Industry of Man
to weed them out who, had he nothing to struggle with, the fire
of his Spirit would be halfe extinguished in the Flesh.&rdquo; After
pointing out that weeding them out is in itself excellent exercise,
he proceeds:&mdash;&ldquo;But further why may not poysonous plants
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>170]</a></span>
draw to them all the maligne juice and nourishment that the
other may be more pure and refined, as well as Toads and other
poysonous Serpents licke the venome from the Earth?... So
have I seen some people when they have burned their fingers to
goe and burne them again to fetch out the fire. And why may
not one poyson fetch out another as well as fire fetch out fire?&rdquo;
&ldquo;For should all things be known at once,&rdquo; he wisely concludes,
&ldquo;Posterity would have nothing left wherewith to gratifie themselves
in their owne discoveries, which is a great encouragement
to active and quick Wits, to make them enquire into those
things which are hid from the eyes of those which are dull
and stupid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Coles&rsquo;s <i>Art of Simpling</i> is the only herbal which devotes
a chapter to herbs useful for animals&mdash;&ldquo;Plants as have operation
upon the bodies of Bruit Beasts.&rdquo; This chapter is full of curious
folk lore. He gives the old beliefs that a toad poisoned by a
spider will cure itself with a plantain leaf; that weasels when
about to encounter a serpent eat rue; that an ass when it feels
melancholy eats asplenium; that wild goats wounded by arrows
cure themselves with dittany; that the swallow uses celandine
(&ldquo;I would have this purposely planted for them,&rdquo; he adds);
that linnet and goldfinch (and have any birds brighter eyes?)
constantly repair their own and their young one&rsquo;s eyesight with
eyebright; that if loosestrife is thrown between two oxen when
they are fighting they will part presently, and being tied about
their necks it will keep them from fighting; that cocks which
have been fed on garlick are &ldquo;most stout to fight and so are
Horses&rdquo;; that the serpent so hates the ash tree &ldquo;that she will
not come nigh the shadow of it, but she delights in Fennel very
much, which she eates to cleer her eyesight;&rdquo; that, if a garden
is infested with moles, garlic or leeks will make them &ldquo;leap
out of the ground presently.&rdquo; Perhaps the most remarkable
effects of herbs are the two following. &ldquo;Adders tongue put
into the left eare of any Horse will make him fall downe as if
he were dead, and when it is taken out againe, he becomes more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>171]</a></span>
lively than he was before.&rdquo; And &ldquo;if Asses chance to feed much
upon Hemlock, they will fall so fast asleep that they will seeme
to be dead, in so much that some thinking them to be dead
indeed have flayed off their skins, yet after the Hemlock had
done operating they have stirred and wakened out of their
sleep, to the griefe and amazement of the owners.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There is one chapter&mdash;&ldquo;Of plants used in and against Witchcraft&rdquo;&mdash;in
which, amongst other things, we learn that the ointment
that witches use is made of the fat of children, dug up
from their graves, and mixed with the juice of smallage, wolfsbane
and cinquefoil and fine wheat flour; that mistletoe, angelica,
etc. were regarded as being of such sovereign power against
witches that they were worn round the neck as amulets. Also,
that in order to prevent witches from entering their houses
the common people used to gather elder leaves on the last day
of April and affix them to their doors and windows. &ldquo;I doe
not desire any to pin their Faiths upon these reports,&rdquo; says
Coles, &ldquo;but only let them know there are such which they may
believe as they please.&rdquo; &ldquo;However,&rdquo; he concludes, &ldquo;there is
no question but very wonderful effects may be wrought by the
Vertues which are enveloped within the compasse of the green
mantles wherewith many Plants are adorned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Coles, nevertheless, treats with scorn, and by arguments
peculiarly his own, the old belief in the connection between the
stars and herbs. &ldquo;It [the study of herbs] is a subject as antient
as the Creation, yea more antient than the Sunne or the Moon,
or Starres, they being created on the fourth day whereas Plants
were the third. Thus did God even at first confute the folly
of those Astrologers who goe about to maintaine that all vegetables
in their growth are enslaved to a necessary and unavoidable
dependence on the influences of the starres; whereas Plants
were even when Planets were not.&rdquo; In another passage, however,
he writes, &ldquo;Though I admit not of Master Culpeper&rsquo;s Astrologicall
way of every Planets Dominion over Plants, yet I
conceive that the Sunne and Moon have generall influence upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>172]</a></span>
them, the one for Heat the other for Moisture; wherein the being
of Plants consists.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The most attractive parts of the <i>Art of Simpling</i> are the
chapters devoted to the &ldquo;Joys of Gardening.&rdquo; Coles tells
us that &ldquo;A house, though otherwise beautifull, if it hath no
garden is more like a prison than a house.&rdquo; Of what he has
to say about gardens and the happiness to be found in gardening
I quote much because it is all so pleasant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That there is no place more pleasant [than a garden] may
appear from God himselfe, who after he had made Man, planted
the Garden of Eden, and put him therein, that he might contemplate
the many wonderful Ornaments wherewith Omnipotency
had bedecked his Mother Earth.... As for recreation, if
a man be wearied with over-much study (for study is a weariness
to the Flesh as Solomon by experience can tell you) there is no
better place in the world to recreate himself than a Garden,
there being no sence but may be delighted therein. If his sight
be obfuscated and dull, as it may easily be, with continuall poring,
there is no better way to relieve it, than to view the pleasant
greennesse of Herbes, which is the way that Painters use, when
they have almost spent their sight by their most earnest contemplation
of brighter objects: neither doe they onely feed the Eyes
but comfort the wearied Braine with fragrant smells. The Eares
also (which are called the Daughters of Musick, because they
delight therein) have their recreation by the pleasant noise of
the warbling notes, which the chaunting birds accent forth from
amongst the murmuring Leaves....&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of the profits&rdquo; [of a garden] he says, &ldquo;First for household
occasions, for there is not a day passeth over our heads but we
have of one thing or other that groweth within their circumference.
We cannot make so much as a little good Pottage
without Herbes, which give an admirable relish and make them
wholsome for our Bodies.... Besides this inestimable Profit
there is another not much inferior to it, and that is the wholsome
exercise a man may use in it.... If Gentlemen which have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>173]</a></span>
little else to doe, would be ruled by me, I would advise them to
spend their spare time in their gardens, either in digging, setting,
weeding or the like, then which there is no better way in the world
to preserve health. If a man want an Appetite to his Victuals
the Smell of the Earth new turned up by digging with a spade
will procure it,<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> and if he be inclined to a Consumption it will
recover him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gentlewomen if the ground be not too wet may doe themselves
much good by kneeling upon a Cushion and weeding.
And thus both sexes might divert themselves from Idlenesse
and evill company, which oftentimes prove the ruine of many
ingenious people. But perhaps they may think it a disparagement
to the condition they are in; truly none at all if it were
but put in practise. For we see that those fashions which
sometimes seem ridiculous if once taken up by the gentry cease
to be so.&rdquo; He quotes the Emperor Diocletian, who &ldquo;left for a
season the whole Government of the Empire and forsaking the
Court betook himself to a meane House with a Garden adjoyning,
wherein with his owne hands, he both sowed set and weeded the
Herbes of his Garden which kinde of life so pleased him, that he
was hardly intreated to resume the Government of the Empire.&rdquo;
&ldquo;By this time,&rdquo; he concludes, &ldquo;I hope you will think it no
dishonour to follow the steps of our grandsire Adam, who is
commonly pictured with a Spade in his hand, to march through
the Quarters of your Garden with the like Instrument, and there
to rectify all the disorders thereof, to procure as much as in
you lyes the recovery of the languishing Art of Simpling, which
did it but appeare in lively colours, I am almost perswaded it
would so affect you that you would be much taken with it.
There is no better way to understand the benefit of it, than by
being acquainted with Herballs and Herbarists and by putting
this Gentle and ingenious Exercise in practise, that so this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>174]</a></span>
part of knowledge as well as others, may receive that esteem
and advancement that is due to it, to the banishment
of Barbarisme and Ignorance which begin again to prevaile
against it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The real descendants, so to speak, of the herbal are the
quaint old still-room books, many of which survive not only
in museums and public libraries, but also in country houses.
These still-room books, which are a modest branch of literature
in themselves, are more nearly akin to herbals than to cookery
books, with which they are popularly associated. For they
are full of the old herb lore and of the uses of herbs in homely
medicines. It must be remembered that even as late as the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries every woman was supposed
to have some knowledge of both the preparation and the medicinal
use of herbs and simples. When the herbal proper ceased
and the first books on botany began to make their appearance
the old herb lore did not fall into disuse, and the popularity of
the still-room books in which it was preserved may be gathered
from the fact that one of the first of these to be printed&mdash;<i>A
Choice Manual of rare and select Secrets in Physick &amp; Chirurgerie
Collected and practised by the Countesse of Kent<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> (late dec&rsquo;d)</i>&mdash;went
through nineteen editions. There are some old books
which merely inspire awe, for one feels that they have always
lived in dignified seclusion on library shelves and have been
handled only by learned scholars. But there are others whose
leaves are so be-thumbed and torn that from constant association
with human beings they seem to have become almost
human themselves. Of this type are these old still-room books.
They were an integral part of daily life and their worn pages
bear mute witness to the fact.</p>

<p class="captonly">FRONTISPIECE OF &ldquo;THE CURIOUS DESTILLATORY,&rdquo; BY THOMAS
SHIRLEY, M.D., PHYSICIAN IN ORDINARY TO HIS MAJESTY (1677)</p>

<p>One of the most interesting is the Fairfax still-room book.<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>
Its first owner was probably Mary Cholmeley, born during the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>175]</a></span>
closing years of Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign, and married in 1626 to the
Rev. the Hon. Henry Fairfax (uncle of the great Parliamentarian
General&mdash;Lord Fairfax).<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> In common with the majority
of MS. still-room books, the Fairfax volume contains much that
has no immediate connection with a still-room, but is full of
human interest. It is a curious medley of culinary recipes,
homely cures, housewifely arts such as bleaching, dyeing,
brewing and preserving, to say nothing of hastily scribbled little
notes regarding lost linen (including no fewer than &ldquo;xxiii
handkerchares!&rdquo;) and the number of fowls, etc., in the poultry-yard.
This last entry, which runs all down one side of a page,
is as follows: &ldquo;I Kapon, XVI Torkies, XVIII dowkes, IIII
henes, II cokes, X chekins, X giese, IV sowes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the most charming entry of all is: &ldquo;A note of Mistress
Barbara her lessons on ye virginalle which she hath learned and
can play them,&rdquo; followed by a list of songs, the majority of
which have the entry &ldquo;Mr. Bird&rdquo; beside them. William Bird
was organist to Queen Elizabeth, and he presumably was
&ldquo;Mistress Barbara&rsquo;s&rdquo; music-master. She apparently also had
lessons from Dr. Bull, then at the height of his fame, for his
name appears in connection with some of the items. Amongst
the songs we find &ldquo;My trew Love is to ye grene Wood gon,&rdquo; and
there are quite a number of dances&mdash;pavanes and courantes&mdash;which
she played. One feels very sure that &ldquo;Mistress Barbara&rdquo;
was a fascinating person, but she could not have been more
lovable than her sister Mary, who married Henry Fairfax. A
love-letter, written in Charles I.&rsquo;s reign, is doubtless quite out
of place in a book on old herbals, but I cannot refrain from
quoting the following, written by Mary to her husband about
six years after their marriage, because it very clearly reveals
the character of one of the many types of women who wrote
these still-room books.</p>

<p>I quote only three recipes from this attractive MS.: &ldquo;A
Bath for Melancholy,&rdquo; &ldquo;Balles for the face&rdquo; and &ldquo;For them
theyr speech faileth.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;To make a bath for Melancholy. Take Mallowes, pellitory
of the wall, of each three handfulls; Camomell flowers, Mellilot
flowers, of each one handfull; hollyhocks, two handfulls; Isop
one greate handfull, senerick seede one ounce, and boil them in
nine gallons of Water untill they come to three, then put in a
quart of new milke and go into it bloud warme or somthing
warmer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Balles for the face. Take greate Allecant reasons [raisins]
a quarter of a pounde, stone them but wash them not and beate
them in a morter very fine, take as many almonds, not Jordans,
but of ye comon sort and blanch them and drye them in a cloth
very well and beate them in a stone morter also very fine, when
you have done thus to them bothe, mingle them bothe together
and beate them againe, and putt to it half a quarter of a pounde
of browne leavened bread, wheaten bread, and beate them
altogeather and mingle them well togeather and then take it
and make it in little balles and then wash yor face at night with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>177]</a></span>
one of them in fayre water. Yf you will have this only to wash
yor hands put in a little Venice soape but putt none of that
in for youre face.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For them theyr speech faileth. Take a handfull of ye
cropps of Rosemary, a handfull of sage and a handfull of Isop
and boile them in malmsey till it be soft, then put them into
Lynen clothes and laye about the nape of the neck and the
pulses of the armes as whott [hot] as it may be suffred daily,
as it shal be thought mete and it will help it by God&rsquo;s grace.
For the same. Take staves acre and beate it and sowe it in a
linnen cloth and make a bagg noe bigger than a beane; if he
can chow it in his mouth lett hym, if not then lay it upon his
tongue.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>To the modern mind the medical recipes to be found in
these still-room books sound truly alarming, but in <i>The Lady
Sedley her Receipt book</i> they are not more so than the prescriptions
which were contributed by the most eminent physicians
of that day. In his paper<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> on this MS. Dr. Guthrie quotes
many of these recipes, amongst them one from the famous
Dr. Stephens,<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> so frequently quoted by Sir Kenelm Digby and
in other still-room books of the period. In Lady Sedley&rsquo;s book
his recipe is introduced thus: &ldquo;A copy to make the sovreigns&rsquo;t
water that ever was devised by man, which Dr. Stephens a
physician of great cuning and of long experience did use and
therewith did cure many great cases, and all was kept in secret
until a little before his death; when the Archbishop of Canterbury
got it from him.&rdquo; Amongst the other contributors to this
MS. were no fewer than three of the doctors who attended
Charles II. in his last illness, and if they gave the king even in
a mild form medicines resembling those we find in this book,
Macaulay&rsquo;s description that &ldquo;they tortured him for some hours
like an Indian at the stake&rdquo; can hardly have been exaggerated.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>178]</a></span>
There is a &ldquo;Receipt for Convulsion Fitts&rdquo; from Sir Edward
Greaves (the first physician to be created a baronet) consisting
of peony roots, dead man&rsquo;s skull, hoofs of asses, white amber
and bezoar; and the famous Dr. Sydenham contributed a
&ldquo;Prescription for the head&rdquo; in which, not content with the
seventy-two ingredients of which Venice treacle consisted, he
added Wormwood, orange peel, angelica and nutmeg. Another
distinguished contributor to this MS. was the ill-fated Duke of
Monmouth. A prescription for stone from Judge Ellis consisted
of Venice turpentine distilled with various herbs and
spices in small ale. It was to be made only in June and taken
&ldquo;three days before the full and three days before the change of
the Moone&rdquo; (incidentally a survival of Saxon moon lore), but
the Duke of Monmouth&rsquo;s prescription for the same complaint
is quite different and is compounded of ripe haws and fennel
roots distilled in white wine and taken with syrup of elder.
Lady Sedley, the first owner, and presumably author of the
book, was the wife of Sir Charles Sedley, one of Charles II.&rsquo;s
intimate friends and notorious for his mad pranks. Between
her husband and her daughter her life must have been almost
unbearable, and it is not surprising that the unfortunate woman
ended her days in a mad-house.</p>

<p>Of the MS. still-room books in the British Museum
undoubtedly the most interesting is <i>Mary Doggett: Her
Book of Receipts</i>, 1682.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> On the first page is affixed a note:
&ldquo;This Mary Doggett was the wife of Doggett the Player who
left a legacy of a yearly coat and badge to be rowed for.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>
The MS. is beautifully written and contains an astonishing
amount of information on every housewifely art, from washing
&ldquo;parti-coloured stockings&rdquo; to making perfumes and &ldquo;Sweete
Baggs.&rdquo; Indeed the reading of the headlines alone gives one
some idea of the multifarious duties of a mistress of a large
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>179]</a></span>
house in those days. We find&mdash;and I quote only a few&mdash;recipes
&ldquo;to make morello cherry cakes,&rdquo; &ldquo;apricock marmalett,&rdquo;
&ldquo;to preserve Cherrys white,&rdquo; &ldquo;to candy oranges or lemons or
any kind of sucketts,&rdquo; &ldquo;to preserve almonds,&rdquo; &ldquo;to preserve
damsons,&rdquo; &ldquo;orange butter,&rdquo; &ldquo;pippin creame,&rdquo; &ldquo;to make
molds for apricock Plumbs,&rdquo; &ldquo;apricock wine,&rdquo; &ldquo;to keep cherrys

&ldquo;to make Lemon Creame,&rdquo; &ldquo;lemon Syllibub,&rdquo; &ldquo;orange biskett,&rdquo;
&ldquo;cheese caks of oranges,&rdquo; &ldquo;to preserve pippins in slices,&rdquo; &ldquo;to

Wallnutts,&rdquo; &ldquo;to preserve double blew violetts for Salletts,&rdquo;
&ldquo;to candy Double marygold, Roses, or any other flowers,&rdquo; &ldquo;to
make good sorrell wine,&rdquo; &ldquo;sweet powders for linnen,&rdquo; &ldquo;to

&ldquo;Almond milk,&rdquo; &ldquo;to pickle cucumbers,&rdquo; &ldquo;drinks to cause
sleep,&rdquo; &ldquo;snaile broth,&rdquo; &ldquo;plasters for bruises,&rdquo; &ldquo;to make
pomades&rdquo; and &ldquo;past for the hands.&rdquo; The receipts for &ldquo;A
Pomander,&rdquo; for &ldquo;Balme water,&rdquo; &ldquo;to dry roses for sweet
powder,&rdquo; and &ldquo;a perfume for a sweet bagg&rdquo; are particularly
attractive, and I give them below.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A Pomander. Take a quarter of an ounce of Civitt, a
quarter and a half-quarter of an ounce of Ambergreese, not half
a quarter of an ounce of ye Spiritt of Roses, 7 ounces of Benjamin,
allmost a pound of Damask Rose buds cutt. Lay
gumdragon in rose water and with it make up your Pomander,
with beads as big as nutmegs and color ym with Lamb [<i>sic</i>] black;
when you make ym up wash your hands wth oyle of Jasmin
to smooth ym, then make ym have a gloss, this quantity will
make seaven Braceletes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A receipt for Balme. Take 6 or 7 handfulls of balme, cut
it a little, put it in an Earthen pott wth a handfull of cowslip
flowers, green or dry, half an ounce of Mace, a little bruised
pow[d]er in ym, 4 quarts of strong ale, let ym stand a night to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>180]</a></span>
infuse: in ye morning put it into your still, poure upon it a
quart of brandy. Past up your Still; you may draw about
2 quarts of water. Sweeten it with Sugar to your Tast and tye
up too pennyworth of Saffron in a ragg, put it into ye water
and let it lye till it be colored. Squeeze it out and bottle it
for your use.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To dry Roses for sweet powder. Take your Roses after
they have layen 2 or 3 days on a Table, then put them into a
dish and sett ym on a chafering dish of Charcole, keeping them
stirred, and as you stir ym strew in some powder of orris, and
when you see them pretty dry put them into a gally pot till
you use them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A perfume for a sweet bagg. Take half a pound of Cypress
Roots, a pound of Orris, 3 quarters of a pound of Rhodium, a
pound of Coriander Seed, 3 quarter of a pound of Calamus,
3 orange stick wth cloves, 2 ounces of Benjamin, and an ounce
of Storax and 4 pecks of Damask Rose leaves, a peck of dryed
sweet Marjerum, a pretty stick of Juniper shaved very thin,
some lemon pele dryed and a stick of Brasill; let all these be
powdered very grosely for ye first year and immediately put
into your baggs; the next year pound and work it and it will
be very good again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Countesse of Kent&rsquo;s&rdquo; still-room book, which was one
of the first to be published, contains more recipes against the
Plague than most, and with one of these we find the instruction
that it must be taken three times, &ldquo;for the first helpeth not.&rdquo;
Amongst much that is gruesome there is a pleasant recipe
entitled &ldquo;A comfortable cordial to cheer the heart,&rdquo; which
runs thus: &ldquo;Take one ounce of conserve of gilliflowers, four
grains of the best Musk, bruised as fine as flower, then put it
into a little tin pot and keep it till you have need to make this
cordial following: Viz.: Take the quantity of one Nutmeg out
of your tin pot, put to it one spoonful of cinnamon water, and
one spoonful of the sirrup of gillifloures, ambergreece, mix all
these together and drink them in the morning, fasting three or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>181]</a></span>
four hours, this is most comfortable.&rdquo; The <i>chef d&rsquo;&oelig;uvre</i> of the
collection, at least in the author&rsquo;s opinion, is one introduced
with this flourish, but it is too long for me to quote more than
the comprehensive title:&mdash;&ldquo;The Countesse of Kent&rsquo;s powder,
good against all malignant and pestilent diseases, French Pox,
Small Pox, Measles, Plague, Pestilence, Malignant or Scarlet
Feavers, good against melancholy, dejection of Spirits, twenty
or thirty grains thereof being exhibited in a little warm Sack
or Hartshorn Jelly to a Man and half as much or twelve grains
to a Childe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Far more attractive than the volume which bears the
&ldquo;Countesse of Kent&rsquo;s&rdquo; name are the little-known books by
Tryon. They are full of discourses and sermons, introduced at
the most unexpected moments. Indeed, there are few subjects
on which Tryon does not lecture his readers, from giving servants
extra work on Sundays by having &ldquo;greasy platters and Bloody-Bones
more on Sunday than any other Day,&rdquo; to sleeping in
feather beds. It is interesting to find that women had already
taken to smoking in the seventeenth century, and Tryon
admonishes them thus:&mdash;&ldquo;Nor is it become infrequent, for
women also to smoak Tobacco. Tobacco being an Herb of
Mars and Saturn, it hath its fiery Quality from Mars, and its
Poysonous fulsome attractive Nature from Saturn: the common
use of it in Pipes is very injurious to all sorts of people but
more especially to the Female Sex.&rdquo; Tryon seems to have been
somewhat of a Socialist, and he takes great delight in commiserating
&ldquo;Lords, Aldermen, the Rich and the Great,&rdquo; who
are driven to &ldquo;heartily envying those Jolley Swains, who feed
only with Bread and Cheese, and trotting up to the knees in
Dirt, do yet with lusty limbs, and vigorous stomach, and merry
Hearts, and undisturbed Heads, whistle out more sollid joys
than the others, with all their Wealth and State can purchase.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The most famous of all still-room books was that written
by Sir Kenelm Digby, the friend of Kings and philosophers and
himself a man of science, a doctor, an occultist, a privateer and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>182]</a></span>
a herbalist. Indeed it would be impossible to catalogue his
activities, and he has always been recognised as the type <i>par
excellence</i> of the gifted amateur. Sir Kenelm was the elder son
of the Digby who was one of the leaders in the Gunpowder
Plot. Himself a man of European reputation, he numbered
among his friends Bacon, Ben Jonson, Galileo, Descartes,
Harvey and Cromwell. Queen Marie de&rsquo; Medici was only one
of many women who fell in love with him, but his one love was
his wife, one of the most beautiful women of her day&mdash;Venetia
Anastasia Stanley, immortalised by Van Dyck and Ben Jonson.
Sir Kenelm Digby was the intimate friend of Charles I. and
Henrietta Maria, and after the Restoration he was a prominent
figure at the Court of Charles II. When the Royal Society
was inaugurated in 1663, he was one of the Council, and his
house in Covent Garden was a centre where all the wits, occultists
and men of letters forgathered. Aubrey tells us that after the
Restoration he lived &ldquo;in the last faire house westward in the
north portico of Covent Garden where my lord Denzill Hollis
lived since. He had a laboratory there.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> One reads so much of
the extravagances and excesses of Restoration days that it is
all the pleasanter to remember the people of whom little has
been written, the thousands of quiet folk who loved their homes
and gardens and took delight in simple pleasures. It is of
these people Sir Kenelm Digby&rsquo;s book reminds us, and even the
names of his recipes are soothing reading&mdash;syllabubs, hydromel,
mead, quidannies, tansies, slipp-coat-cheeses, manchets, and so
forth. Moreover, there is no savour of the shop in these
recipes, the book being full rather of flowers and herbs. It is
also very leisurely, and in these days that, too, is soothing.
Time we frequently find measured thus:&mdash;&ldquo;Whiles you can
say the Miserere Psalm very slowly&rdquo; or &ldquo;about an Ave Maria
while.&rdquo; It takes us back to a simple old world when great
ladies not only looked well to the ways of their households, but
attended themselves to the more important domestic matters.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>183]</a></span>
Sir Kenelm collected these recipes assiduously from his friends,
and each housekeeper&rsquo;s pride in her speciality is very evident.
To mention only a few of these, we find:&mdash;&ldquo;Scotch Ale from my
Lady Holmeby,&rdquo; &ldquo;A very pleasant drink of Apples,&rdquo; &ldquo;Master
Webb&rsquo;s Ale and Bragot,&rdquo; &ldquo;Apples in Gelly,&rdquo; &ldquo;To make
Bisket,&rdquo; &ldquo;Sir Paul Neal&rsquo;s way of making Cider,&rdquo; &ldquo;My Lord
of St. Alban&rsquo;s Cresme Fouettee,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Queen&rsquo;s Barley Cream,&rdquo;
&ldquo;To pickle capons my Lady Portland&rsquo;s way,&rdquo; &ldquo;Pickled Champignons,&rdquo;
&ldquo;A Flomery-Caudle,&rdquo; &ldquo;My Lord Hollis Hydromel,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Master Corsellises Antwerp Meath,&rdquo; &ldquo;My own considerations
for making of Meathe,&rdquo; &ldquo;Meathe from the Muscovian Ambassadors
Steward,&rdquo; &ldquo;White Metheglin of my Lady Hungerford&rsquo;s
which is exceedingly praised,&rdquo; &ldquo;My Lord of Denbigh&rsquo;s Almond
March-pane,&rdquo; &ldquo;My Lord Lumley&rsquo;s Pease-pottage,&rdquo; &ldquo;Pease of
the seed, buds of Tulips,&rdquo; &ldquo;A soothing Quiddany or Gelly of
the Cores of Quinces,&rdquo; &ldquo;Sack with clove gilly-flowers,&rdquo; &ldquo;My
Lord of Carlile&rsquo;s Sack-posset,&rdquo; &ldquo;To make a whip Syllabub,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Sucket of Mallow-stalks,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Countess of Newport&rsquo;s Cherry
Wine.&rdquo; We may forget the recipes themselves, but the
memory of them is associated with the fragrance of gillifiowers,
roses, cowslips, elder flowers, violets, thyme, marjoram and the
like. I give but these few below, and I wish there were space
for more; for not only are they excellent in themselves, but,
in common with all those in Sir Kenelm Digby&rsquo;s book, they give
more, perhaps, of the atmosphere of the old still-rooms than
is to be found in any other collection.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;Sweet meat of Apples. My Lady Barclay makes her fine
Apple-gelly with slices of John apples. Sometimes she mingles
a few pippins with the Johns to make the gelly. But she
liketh best the Johns single and the colour is paler. You first
fill the glass with slices round-wise cut, and then the Gelly is
poured in to fill up the vacuities. The Gelly must be boiled
to a good stiffness. Then when it is ready to take from the
fire, you put in some juyce of Lemon, and of Orange too, if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>184]</a></span>
you like it, but these must not boil; yet it must stand a while
upon the fire stewing in good heat, to have the juyces incorporate
and penetrate well. You must also put in some
Ambergreece, which doth exceeding well in this sweet-meat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wheaten Flommery. In the West Country they make a
kind of Flommery of wheat flower, which they judge to be
more harty and pleasant then that of Oat-meal, thus; take
half, or a quarter of a bushel of good Bran of the best wheat
(which containeth the purest flower of it, though little, and is
used to make starch), and in a great wooden bowl or pail, let
it soak with cold water upon it three or four days. Then strain
out the milky water from it, and boil it up to a gelly or like
starch. Which you may season with Sugar and Rose or Orange-flower-water
and let it stand till it be cold, and gellied. Then
eat it with white or Rhenish-wine, or Cream, or Milk, or Ale.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A Flomery Caudle. When Flomery is made and cold, you
may make a pleasant and wholesome caudle of it by taking
some lumps and spoonfuls of it, and boil it with Ale and White
wine, then sweeten it to your taste with Sugar. There will
remain in the Caudle some lumps of the congealed flomery
which are not ungrateful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Conserve of Red Roses. Doctor Glisson makes his Conserve
of red Roses thus: Boil gently a pound of red Rose-leaves
(well picked, and the nails cut off) in about a pint and a half
(or a little more, as by discretion you shall judge fit, after
having done it once; the Doctor&rsquo;s Apothecary takes two pints)
of Spring water; till the water have drawn out all the Tincture
of the Roses into itself, and that the leaves be very tender, and
look pale like Linnen; which may be in a good half hour, or
an hour, keeping the pot covered whiles it boileth. Then pour
the tincted Liquor from the pale leaves (strain it out, pressing
it gently, so that you may have Liquor enough to dissolve
your Sugar) and set it upon the fire by itself to boil, putting
into it a pound of pure double refined Sugar in small Powder;
which as soon as it is dissolved, put into it a second pound, then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>185]</a></span>
a third, lastly a fourth, so that you have four pounds of sugar
to every pound of Rose-leaves. (The Apothecary useth to put
all the four pounds into the Liquor altogether at once.) Boil
these four pounds of Sugar with the tincted Liquor, till it be a
high Syrup, very near a candy height (as high as it can be not
to flake or candy). Then put the pale Rose-leaves into this
high Syrup, as it yet standeth upon the fire, or immediately
upon the taking it off the fire. But presently take it from
the fire, and stir them exceeding well together, to mix them
uniformly; then let them stand till they be cold, then pot
them up. If you put your Conserve into pots whiles it is yet
thoroughly warm, and leave them uncovered some days, putting
them in the hot Sun or stove, there will grow a fine candy on
the top, which will preserve the conserve without paper upon
it, from moulding, till you break the candied crust to take
out some of the conserve.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The colour both of the Rose-leaves and the Syrup about
them, will be exceedingly beautiful and red, and the taste
excellent, and the whole very tender and smoothing, and easie
to digest in the stomack without clogging it, as doth the ordinary

is very rough in the throat. The worst of it is, that if you

<p>Under another &ldquo;conserve of red roses&rdquo; we find this note:&mdash;&ldquo;Doctor
Bacon useth to make a pleasant Julip of this Conserve
of Roses, by putting a good spoonful of it into a large drinking
glass or cup; upon which squeeze the juyce made of a Lemon,
and slip in unto it a little of the yellow rinde of the Lemon;
work these well together with the back of a spoon, putting
water to it by little and little, till you have filled up the glass
with Spring water: so drink it. He sometimes passeth it
through an Hypocras bag and then it is a beautiful and pleasant
Liquor.&rdquo;</p>

These still-room books are as much part of a vanished past
as the old herb-gardens, those quiet enclosures full of sunlight
and delicious scents, of bees and fairies, which we foolish moderns
have allowed to fall into disuse. The herb garden was always
the special domain of the housewife, and one likes to think of
the many generations of fair women who made these gardens
their own, tending them with their own hands, rejoicing in
their beauty and peace and interpreting in humble, human
fashion something of the wonder and mystery of Nature in
the loveliness of a garden enclosed. For surely this was the
charm of these silent secluded places, so far removed from
turmoil that from them it was possible to look at the world
with clear eyes and a mind undisturbed by clamour. And what
of the fairies in those gardens? We live in such a hurrying,
material age that even in our gardens we seem to have forgotten
the fairies, who surely have the first claim on them. Does not
every child know that fairies love thyme and foxgloves and
the lavish warm scent of the old cabbage rose? Surely the
fairies thronged to those old herb-gardens as to a familiar
haunt. Can you not see them dancing in the twilight?</p>

<p>The dark elves of Saxon days have well-nigh vanished with
the bogs and marshes and the death-like vapours which gave
them birth. With the passing of centuries the lesser elves have
become tiny of stature and friendly to man, warming themselves
by our firesides and disporting themselves in our gardens.
Perhaps now they even look to us for protection, lest in this
age of materialism they be driven altogether from the face of
the earth. As early as the twelfth century we find mention of
creatures akin to the brownies, whom we all love; for the
serious Gervase of Tilbury tells us of these goblins, less than
half an inch high, having faces wrinkled with age, and dressed
in patched garments. These little creatures, he assures us,
come and work at night in the houses of mankind; but they
had not lost their impish ways and elvish tricks, &ldquo;for at times
when Englishmen ride abroad in the darkness of night, an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>187]</a></span>
unseen Portunos [Brownie?] will join company with the wayfarer;
and after riding awhile by his side will at length seize
his reins and lead his horse into the slough wherein he will
stick and wallow while the Portunos departs with mocking
laughter, thus making sport of man&rsquo;s simplicity.&rdquo; Perhaps
they still make sport of our simplicity, but we shall be the
losers if they vanish altogether from the earth. If in impish
mood they lead the wayfarer into sloughs, do not the sheen-bright
elves lighten some of the darkest paths of pain which
human beings are forced to tread? Are not these Ariel-like
creatures links between the flowers of earth which they haunt
and the stars of heaven whence they seem to derive their
radiance? The fairies have almost deserted us, but perhaps
they will one day come back to our gardens and teach us that
there is something true, though beyond what we can know, in
the old astrological lore of the close secret communion between
stars and flowers. Do not flowers seem to reflect in microscopic
form those glorious flowers which deck the firmament of heaven?
In many flowers there is something so star-like that almost
unconsciously our minds connect them with the luminaries in
the great expanse above us, and from this it seems but a short
step to the belief that there is between them a secret communion
which is past our understanding.</p>

John Archer (one of the Physicians in Ordinary to Charles II.) also
asserts in his <i>Compendious Herbal</i> (1673) that &ldquo;the Sun doth not draw away
the Vertues of Herbs, but adds to them.&rdquo; Archer gives full astrological
directions for the gathering of herbs:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have mentioned in the ensuing Treatise of Herbs the Planet that Rules
every Herb for this end, that you may the better understand their Nature
and may gather them when they are in their full strength, which is when the
Planet is especially strong, and then in his own Hour gather your Herb;
therefore that you may know what hour belongs to every Planet take notice
that Astrologers do assign the seven days of the week to the seven planets,
as to the Sun or &#8857; Sunday; to the Moon or &#9789; Monday; to Mars or &#9794; Tuesday; to
Mercury or &#9791; Wednesday; to Jupiter or &#9795; Thursday; to Venus or &#9792; Friday;
to Saturn or &#9796; Saturday. And know that every Planet governs the first
Hour after Sun Rise upon his day and the next Planet to him takes the next
Hour successively in this order, &#9796;, &#9795;, &#9794;, &#8857;, &#9792;, &#9791;, &#9789;, &#9796;, &#9795;. So be it any
day every Seventh Hour comes to each Planet successively, as if the day be
Thursday then the first hour after Sun Rising is Jupiter&rsquo;s, the next &#9794;, the next
&#8857;, next &#9792;. So on till it come to &#9795; again. And if you gather Herbs in their
Planetary Hour you may expect to do Wonders, otherwise not; to Astrologers
I need say nothing; to others this is as much as can easily be learnt.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>The
Compendious Herbal</i>, by John Archer, One of his Majesties Physicians in
Ordinary.</p>

In this connection he quotes Dr. Pinck, Warden of New College, Oxford,
who, when he was &ldquo;almost fourscore yeares old, would rise very betimes in
the morning and going into his Garden he would take a Mattock or Spade,
digging there an hour or two, which he found very advantageous to his health.&rdquo;</p>
